P1	oh um yes so I've been using it but it hurts when I inject it um so I haven't been using it every day I think I was supposed to use it every day but every two or three days I've been using
P2	it it's really important that you use your insulin exactly as prescribed it's really dangerous to let your blood Sugar's run high. what have they been when you test them?
P1	um well anytime that I test it if it's about  i use it i use Manson so usually don't let it get higher than that
