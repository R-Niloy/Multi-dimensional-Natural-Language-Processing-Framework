P2	good afternoon miss Joe knobbly my name is
P1	afternoon
P2	my name is Jessamine all knobbly and I will be leading you through our nutrition and education and counselling meeting today
P1	okay
P2	just a little bit about myself I am a Nutrition and Dietetics student at Loma Linda University and we'll be sitting for my Rd exam next June
P1	fantastic
P2	so I just want tell you know I got into this field because I just really wanted to enhance and improve people's health through making advantageous dietary choices so
P1	that's great
P2	before we get started would you like a bottle of water
P1	I'd love to have a bunch of water
P2	okay
P1	thank you very much sure yeah can I start drinking now
P2	yes go for it so in today's session I would just like to hear about some of your personal goals why you came to the session today obstacles you may be facing in regards to nutrition and just figure out some ways to overcome challenges that you may be facing
P1	okay well number one I'm really really happy to have this opportunity to sit down with you and discuss my really horrible eating habits especially by you know recently I have been actually struggling with wanting to lose the weight I would say for about a good six seven months now and all that I have seen so far is that I've been basically actually basically fluctuating between 199 and 206 sometimes even 208 the struggle today has been the frustration level of when I get on this okay I'm going to get on this quote-unquote diet and I'm going to lose the weight something amazing happens I actually end up painting I'm tired in the morning I'm stressed because we started this whole new business that we have here and I'm totally out of control I feel that I'm totally out of control when it comes to eating I think a lot of it has to do with not eating quote/unquote properly or systematically
P2	okay so for you I just threw a lot at me so I'd like to go back and recap some of the things that you were saying to make sure that I'm understanding everything clearly
P1	okay
P2	so in January 2010 you started a meal plan that was very strict and you were able to maintain it for a few years
P1	no few months
P2	few months yes you think a few months and then you started to travel and you know kind of things kind of went a little bit astray from there
P1	yes
P2	you went from this strict dieting all-or-nothing kind of plan do not really knowing how to make food for yourself or compose a meal for yourself because you were
P1	let me was you know it's interesting you say that because that meal plan that I was on that diet plan yeah what's called a no decision
P2	yes it's a
P1	no decision diet which means you don't have to make any decisions about anything this is the prescription and you live with that prescription you'd be alright anyone else I kind of denied it
P2	so you almost kind of missed out on the education portion of how to eat when you're on your own
P1	yes
P2	which is what in the long term we want to achieve is for you to be able to make healthy food choices when someone isn't there to tell you what to do you're able to critically think for yourself and regardless the nutrition
P1	yeah
P2	so some other things that you mentioned was that you're just feeling frustrated and kind of out of control in regards to your weight-loss initiatives which I can which is very it seems very frustrating if you want to be losing weight and you're not not seeing it and then you said that you were tend to be eating more so those are all very frustrating things and not and then you also said that during your day you're not really eating consistently
P1	at all
P2	you're kind of all over the place and kind of looking for more of you know consistent meal plan day in which you're not you know starving and then overeating later
P1	I do the kind of like keeping it's like I wish I had one person walking behind me this fear you whatever that says okay mealtime here it is it was like preparing it here it is you know so that because I just eat such a stressful and such a work living environment
P2	let's talk about where you get most of your meals from
P1	I would literally stop at the supermarket or I would stop at a 7-eleven or I would stop at a couple of times I didn't know a lot of times i stopped at Dunkin Donuts right that pick up the donuts or at the other daughter shop I would pick up because it's fast a lot of times I'm eating out and it's not you know the best thing in the world
P2	okay um so I'm hearing that you get most of your meals from outside of the home
P1	yes
P2	and not typically cooking meals and kind of go for those more convenience convenience meals that's easy yes so how would you feel about going over some tips for when you're dining out that if that's if you're very busy and like that's the option that you're doing right now I'm just making some little tweaks because cooking at home may not be an option for you at this moment
P1	that's very true probably I would say yes
P2	so making little changes
P1	yes in regards to the restaurant is the way everything changes
P2	yes are some some tips that you can implement when you're at the restaurant
P1	okay
P2	so some of the things that I would like to talk about so when you're ordering food from a restaurant you want to stay away from words such as like fried or just like also deep fried and kind of go for those words like royal bake and steam
P1	okay
P2	so recently you told me that you went to a restaurant and I have the menu printed out here and I would give you a copy of that
P1	yes
P2	and and you told me that you ordered the New York strip steak
P1	yes
P2	and you had bread and butter for your meal
P1	yes I do
P2	so just looking at the options here we do have a fresh fish option at the top
P1	yes
P2	and it says it's simply grilled with olive oil or you could get it pan-seared baked or blackened with lemon shallot butter
P1	mm-hm
P2	so I would probably say maybe to stay away from the lemon shallot butter noise and maybe steer towards that simply grilled with olive oil or the maybe the baked or
P1	a boy in this use
P2	you could do the pan serve but the other ones are better option
P1	okay
P2	so that's um -
P1	I would have enjoyed the tilapia for exam
P2	okay so
P1	that's what I like to eat that they were Chilean sea bass I would have enjoyed that too
P2	so that's an opportunity that you would be
P1	yeah
P2	you enjoy billing to go change
P1	yeah
P2	so going for those terms and maybe doing like maybe a fish option every once in a while as opposed to doing a steak
P1	yes
P2	okay some other tips so when you're ordering if you want to order a salad instead of ordering the salad and getting kind of like a Caesar dressing or something like that they typically kind of put a lot of dressing on salads so maybe ordering it on the side is a better option because then you can be in control of how much you would like to add on to the salad
P1	okay
P2	and typically going for maybe like a balsamic dressing is good or you could do a balsamic and olive oil dressing
P1	mm-hmm
P2	typically most restaurants will have that option
P1	yes and I like both stomach vinaigrette
P2	so also in regards to restaurants portion sizes are typically very large and you had mentioned earlier that you know sometimes you just don't know when to stop eating or you tip you think you're hungrier than you are you just eat a lot at once
P1	yes
P2	when you give that example with the bread
P1	yes
P2	so a good tip is to kind of ask for a to-go box in the beginning when you get to the restaurant
P1	mm-hmm
P2	after your meal comes and just put half of the food in the box and you don't open the box can't get home it's kind of bang for your buck too right because then you can either other real later
P1	yes
P2	and you could if you do choose a healthy option you can take it to work the next day and you'll have a lunch option for you here at the office
P1	yes
P2	um also when it comes to salads you really don't so here they have the chopped spinach salad for example there's bacon egg radishes mushrooms and warm bacon dressing just because a menu item has all these things included does not mean that you have to get it with all those things in it
P1	okay
P2	so you can easily tell them oh can I have the chopped chicken it's chopped spinner salad without the bacon
P1	right I don't like bacon
P2	so that is something that you could ask for for that side because I mean spinach is great mushrooms are great radishes are great egg is great you can always take out egg whites I mean the egg yolk if you don't want the egg yolk or anything like that so a lot of restaurants I think analogies are accommodating because they want to have your certainty they want to have your business
P1	yes
P2	so they're gonna try their best to make the customer happy
P1	yes
P2	so for me personally I often ask for changes in my in my orders unless they specifically specified please do not make changes on to the order or we can't make a change for this order I typically change majority of my orders
P1	hmm
P2	because the foods that you eat or the foods that are commercially made are not necessarily the healthiest
P1	yes
P2	they're made to appease the palate
P1	right
P2	so they usually have lots of fat and you know sugar and sodium and those kinds of things added to it to appeal to a wider variety of individuals
P1	mm-hmm
P2	I have a little handout here so we can talk about some like portion sizes
P1	okay
P2	so a fist would be considered like a cup of rice or pasta or fruits or vegetables it's about the size of your fist is one serving
P1	now that's cooked rice oh
P2	yes good right the palm of your hand is about three ounces so that would be for fish meat or poultry that's about the size some people say like a deck of cards it's about 4 ounces
P1	hmm
P2	it's around there and then if you're gonna have nuts of reasons a handful is about 1 ounce there's like a little handful so one thumb would be one ounce of hard cheese or peanut butter and you said
P1	Wow I love cheese you know
P2	and then for your thumb is a a teaspoon of our thumb tip is a tea spoon of cooking oil or margarine or butter and sugar
P1	teaspoon
P2	as a teaspoon why don't you try and start setting some goals for you in regards to some food we do
P1	okay
P2	of what would work
P1	that seem so you go one
P2	so what is what is one goal
P1	that you want you would like to accomplish for what's the eating out that I want to accomplish for eating out
P2	yeah so would you um what a goal be that you want to choose grilled options
P1	well I see
P2	what you mean okay are you willing to do that choose grilled options
P1	you know it's sometimes that would be a goal
P2	so how do you feel about journaling
P1	hate was difficult to do but it was very exciting
P2	mm-hmm
P1	because it is making me it helps me actually meet that objective
P2	okay so that seems like something that we could
P1	yeah I usually get up with you already six o'clock in the morning
P2	would you have time to journal that
P1	yeah I can make the time for that
P2	okay so um how many of these a week would you say you could draw
P1	I can technically journal every day
P2	okay so why don't you give a range of times so why don't we say four to seven times a week in the mornings for we can say until our next session so we can go you can go back and recap how the journaling is going for you
P1	what am i generally I'm gonna do it in the morning
P2	generally how you're feeling physically maybe the food reflect on the food choices that you had made the day before maybe set some you said you like setting little objectives maybe little mini goals for yourself for the day things like that
P1	that is easy for me to choose actually
P2	okay that's great so why don't we just make sure we're doing that let's say seventy-five percent of the time you're eating out
P1	okay that is really very doable for me
P2	okay
P1	because I do it every lunchtime when I go that's exactly
P2	what I do we try and good ideas living by kind of like an 8020 percent rule so eighty percent of the time you're making healthy choices twenty percent of the time you can kind of you know feel like you're not as restricted because it seemed like in the past being on a very strict diet doesn't work in the long run because that's not how life works
P1	yeah
P2	and things are thrown at you and you have to be a little bit valuable to your different situation
P1	yes
P2	so those are some good goals now I would like to talk a little bit maybe up some physical activity
P1	yes so I would love to be accused might cost me too much money
P2	yes so I'm understand that you do want to become more physically active and you've had experience in the past being physically active what do you feel has prevented you from from being physically active is it time is it being tired
P1	it's actually both time being tired
P2	okay you know what kinds of physical activity do you enjoy doing if you were to do physical activity what do you like doing
P1	I would I'm looking
P2	biking swimming activities
P1	I love swimming
P2	okay
P1	I would I don't mind actually gonna get a treadmill on the place I don't I do enjoy those things because they do we find me when I do it I don't just like I'm tired
P2	you start that's difficult he's very different getting there
P1	yes yes
P2	okay so um okay so starting is difficult but just remember that any little changes you're making are are good even if it's going to the gym for just a little bit in 20 or 15 20 minutes or just walking outside of your house and you know after work or in the morning around the lunch break just going outside getting some fresh air how do you feel about maybe parking further
P1	I do that
P2	okay
P1	you know it's interesting but I don't do it all the time
P2	so maybe we'd like to set a goal for that so what about well what what seems good for you how often do you want to do it every time
P1	what
P2	would you like to park far
P1	actually get all the time for a while I did and then I stopped I'm gonna park like the closest I can
P2	so even that alone will give you a little bit more
P1	that's physical activity
P2	exercise so maybe parking I don't know an exact distance but parking further away if you're going to the grocery store if you're going in and out of places just walking more in general
P1	yes but I get the idea though
P2	typically once you start something you kind of like and start seeing results
P1	yes
P2	so that's where your motivation
P1	yes yes
P2	so your motivation lies and seeing results
P1	yes yes
P2	okay so then something to remember is that results don't come overnight and that's hard
P1	yes
P2	to have to stick to something and constantly remembering that and maybe that's something you could write about in your journaling too I'm saying that results literally writing results don't happen overnight
P1	mm-hmm
P2	because if you do stick to a plan over time you will see results yes we exciting for you
P1	yes
P2	I'm the greatest so maybe getting up in the morning and going on the treadmill how often would you be willing to do that sure we
P1	you know
P2	it's realistic a week realistically
P1	I mean I would love to do is float accent
P2	four times a week so for how long do you think you can even go on
P1	I always wanted to be on the treadmill for about 60 minutes
P2	60
P1	yeah it feels good when I'm on threatening for 60 minutes
P2	do you think that would be realistic for your schedule and now that we're saying that we're gonna be journal
P1	you start out you mean you know
P2	okay so why don't we start trying with 20 minutes
P1	okay
P2	so for 15 or 10 minutes or 50 Matt what works best for your schedule
P1	well
P2	what is realistic
P1	I have to tell you that I have tried the 10 and 15 minutes and it doesn't do much at all it doesn't feel like I have done much you know I mean
P2	over time
P1	I guess it depends on how I'm using the treadmill
P2	mm-hmm and over time it will help but you also have to couple it with your with I don't is
P1	I put down 20 minutes
P2	20 minutes
P1	doctor for 20 minutes or day for four days a week
P2	mm-hmm
P1	excuse me on the treadmill and I can start without doing the incline or anything just to get myself back into doing it
P2	okay
P1	getting used to it
P2	yeah it's going through the motions so yeah well it becomes kind of second nature
P1	right right
P2	they say it takes about like 27 or 30 somewhere around their days to develop a habit
P1	I really that's interesting point
P2	I'll have to get you the exact number later but yeah so for it to start feeling second nature so it seems like you are really you want to make you're you're preparing to make the changes right so
P1	yes
P2	you know you know that you want to make the changes and you feel ready to make you feel ready to make these changes
P1	I actually do yes I mean I'm was really really happy when you approached me to have this this meeting I really was and that's why I was sharing with you the details
P2	mhm
P1	it's almost like going to confession and because because I don't feel good about where I am I really don't
P2	maybe one last thing I can mention right now
P1	um
P2	his water
P1	is why it's I like water and I it's easy for me to drink water is because my throat got used to actually taking in that much water it's not a five-piece to be a fight than to begin
P2	yeah
P1	you know
P2	that's like me to drinking water for me is a struggle and I have to make myself do it but I know that I'll feel rejuvenated and I'll my body will function better and let my metabolic processes happen like they should and get my food and digestive system going so they're very I mean we're made up of mostly water so your thought you brought he needs that
P1	yes
P2	and just keeps you more alert when you're dehydrated do typically more sluggish and you're less more likely to make poor nutrition decisions
P1	yes yeah
P2	so just drinking water so why don't we you said you've done it in the past right how do you feel about drinking five bottles
P1	I honestly would not mind at all especially if I started exercising I think
P2	so you know it's really cool as they have apps now
P1	though
P2	that you can track how much water you're drinking I'll have to drop
P1	and you give them out to anyone that for you
P2	mmm-hmm yeah and you can track how much water you're drinking out of there and there's other web sites or apps like MyFitnessPal that you can track what you're eating and it will track all the calories and things like that for your day so why don't we go over um why don't we recap some of the goals so I just wanted me to say your understanding you know what we went through and some things that we talked about
P1	okay let me tell you what they are
P2	yes please
P1	okay so the first thing he said is how about if I did some journaling and he said to do it between four and seven times per week in the morning and then I should actually indicate also in my journaling how I feel also he said to reflect on the food choices that I made for the day the day before and that should be part of my journaling
P2	yes you should be noting some goals for the rest of the day so I want to drink five remember to drink five bottles of water
P1	and I last part of my journal
P2	things like that just was kind of like reminders for yourself
P1	okay the second thing there were five things all together the second thing was we talked about restaurants because I eat a lot
P2	mm-hmm
P1	and he said that I really should choose always put in my mind that I should be choosing Royal Baker steamed 70% of the time but if I go with the 8020 rule it would be good I can do 82% of the time I should be doing good choice since 20% of time it can't be bad choices that's okay because many minutes so that's basically what I remember you say
P2	well I also want to reiterate that it's you know there's no good food and bad food right there's no such thing as good food bad food that's when we we come to pick like portion sizes right
P1	Oh
P2	so food is food
P1	yes
P2	but we want to have more you know plant-based foods and we meats and low-fat dairy and whole grains and things like that
P1	um
P2	and fruits and things because of all the health benefits that they have
P1	yeah
P2	and then we want to you know for sweets and other other treats and desserts we want to keep them as treats and desserts and by doing by keeping a portion the size small we can also you know continue our goal of weight loss
P1	okay
P2	because we don't want to you know deprive you and then all of a sudden oh I want to binge eat all this food
P1	right
P2	so and you know there's you know events and parties and things like that that you kind of need to be you know okay with you know living a little bit
P1	yes
P2	so that's it
P1	okay that's very good points and I noted those things the third thing is the physical activity he said that I should really begin if I do like and enjoy using the treadmill for example I ought to consider maybe 20 minutes to start every 29 to 30 days chances are you will develop a habit
P2	I don't remember the exact timeframe but it's somewhere around there
P1	okay
P2	maybe keep it as a goal just to get there just to get to that
P1	oh yes yes
P2	mm-hmm
P1	even if you go into the office
P2	yeah
P1	so that's very logic number five the fifth thing you talked about is which was more of an educational piece and you said it was all about calories and you said that what I should be considering is taking in about what would be 500 less calories per day and if I did that it would equate a loss of one pound per week
P2	yes
P1	and and don't forget to increase your water intake by basically take the five bottles that I basic I was saying that I used to do so start drinking more water and drink water is because carbohydrates attached themselves to water and it is a good idea to reduce carbohydrates are important for the body but at the same time a lower intake of the carbohydrates would probably be helpful in weight loss
P2	well it will have to be helpful with water I mean it will result in water weight loss but that's not really fat loss so that removes water weight will come back when you drink a bunch of water again so that's not really the weight loss were looking for we want fat loss
P1	okay
P2	you want a decrease in fat and increase in lean mass
P1	so I mean how are you gonna lose the fat the yeah the fat loss
P2	through your diet and just exercising well and
P1	better choices you write coochie which is basically I always think Roy big steam right
P2	yes because three 3
