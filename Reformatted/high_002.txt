P2	hi my name is Laura I'm the pharmacist let me just look you up in the computer
P1	sure
P2	your person laughing
P1	reset feels
P2	and your date of birth
P1	April 28 1962
P2	okay I see that you've filled it here before
P1	mm-hmm
P2	tell me about how you're using the insulin
P1	okay um so usually at night I'll check my blood sugar and then if it's pretty high like about like 15 or so I'll use it that day so usually end up using it about three or four times a week
P2	so you're testing a lot
P1	mm-hmm
P2	at least every day
P1	yes
P2	and then you are using the unplanned when you feel like your blood sugars are running high
P1	even exactly
P2	and how do you feel your implants working for that
P1	I think it's good because my sugars aren't about 14 every day so it must be working it must work her maybe even a couple of days so it's pretty effective
P2	do you feel like you've seen some real improvements on that
P1	yeah definitely
P2	okay so tell me why you're only using it when your blood sugar goes high
P1	oh okay yeah so I was supposed to use it everyday at first I think um which I was like the first week that I had it I started injecting everyday I don't carry about a week it's your to hurt when I was inject here so that's when I started doing it less often thinking if I kind of gave this skin a couple days to heal it wouldn't hurt as much by the next time I I gave myself the injection
P2	so you were experiencing some pain who knows what I'd like you to kind of use it a little left off
P1	yeah it hurts a lot when I check
P2	and you feel like that's really impacting your day
P1	mm-hmm I do yeah
P2	okay so sounds like you've seen some improvement your blood Sugar's have been sometimes under control what have you discuss with your doctor recently
P1	um why has she haven't seen my doctor since I started the insulin so I guess I haven't told him I'm not using it every day like he wanted I hope you I hope you understand
P2	well you're here today for the refill and it seems like you're really committed to getting your blood Sugar's under control
P1	mm-hmm
P2	there are some options that we could discuss about how to reduce pain when you inject
P1	okay that sounds good
P2	there are also some suggestions that I could make about how to keep your blood Sugar's under control best
P1	okay I like below 15
