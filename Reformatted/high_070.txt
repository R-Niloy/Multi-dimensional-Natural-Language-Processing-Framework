P2	hi Michael it's good to see ya well glad you came in today when I douse up
P1	well I came back here because I had to I had to make an appointment so I could get my prescription for my blood pressure medicine refilled and they wouldn't do it it wouldn't refill it it's a drugstore unless I came back here so
P2	you're you're angry what
P1	well I'm not angry at you but I'm angry at the situation and I gotta come back in here take time off from work just to get that prescription filled but but you know you do what you got to do and
P2	well I appreciate your bringing that up that is does sound frustrating but by coming in it gives us a chance to to sit down and and and talk and see how things are going with the medication which is what I'm most concerned about I know we started at about three months ago or so and I am real interested to hear how you're how you're doing on
P1	well uh yeah whenever I get my blood pressure checked at the drugstore it looks like I'm that it's working and that respect but it does seem to take away all my energy you know
P2	kind of fatigued
P1	yeah yeah my I got no get up and go if you know what I mean
P2	so kind of has taken the wind out of your sails
P1	absolutely yeah
P2	how long have you noticed that
P1	oh I don't know I at least since I've been on this medication at least that long
P2	yeah doesn't sound like it's working well too working too well for you have you tell me about how you're taking the medication have you taking it very regular
P1	oh yeah I take it I take it just like it says take it on the bottle you know I take it every morning when I get up
P2	okay so you've been pretty consistent and taken
P1	the all yes
P2	anything else going on in terms of symptoms no just this overall lack of energy which I know my wife doesn't particularly care for
P2	your wife coming a little bit more about how it affects the relationship between the two of you
P1	well as I say I get up and go got up and went and there's not much going on between the two of us like there used to be
P2	so sexual performance is not as good as it as it might be
P1	nope but I think it's because of that damn medicine
P2	so does this sound like something that you want to continue or should we talk about possibly other other options for you it sounds like it's kind of affecting your life negatively well
P1	yeah yeah but you know I I'm worried about my blood pressure because my my mother had a stroke not long ago and I know it was so they told us it was because of her high blood pressure so I don't want that to happen to me
P2	so you're concerned about having a stroke
P1	well yeah I mean would you be you know it sort of runs in families I think
P2	yeah so taking care of your blood pressure is is very important to you
P1	yeah yeah absolutely
P2	again it doesn't sound like this particular medicines working out too well for you if it's okay I could talk to you about possibly changing the medication so on the one hand we'd be keeping your blood pressure under control but on the other hand we wouldn't be causing these types of side effects hopefully would that be okay
P1	well are you talking about on more medications or just a different medication
P2	yeah so uh I think probably it sounds to me like probably changing medications at this point as a start we can always add another medication later if that becomes necessary
P1	yeah well I'm not real interested in adding any more but if changing it it would keep my blood pressure down but not take away all my energy than I might that give better idea
P2	so you'd at least be willing to try a change and and see how that goes
P1	yeah yeah I know well
P2	if it's okay I can tell you about a group of medications that I I like but if but first if it's okay that they give you a kind of my rationale for using that medication to start with so you know one of the things you'd mentioned to me was some of the financial concerns and the medication that you're on is pretty dirt-cheap and for most people at this dose particularly a low dose because you have mild hypertension most of the time it doesn't have many side effects obviously for you that was different does that make sense
P1	yeah
P2	yeah so the medication I'm thinking about is something called an ACE inhibitor ACE inhibitors are very very well tolerated and occasionally people will get a dry hacky cough with them but it's fairly rare but there's very low risk of side effects in terms of sexual side effects in particular and most people as a matter of fact it's one of the the drugs that actually helps your heart beat a little bit stronger and better and many people don't have any kind of a decrease in their energy so how does that sound
P1	yeah it sounds though it sounds like a good idea if it still controls my blood pressure but doesn't take away my energy it sounds like a good idea
P2	okay so what other things can you tell me about that might affect your blood pressure
P1	uh-oh uh-oh my work is sometimes stressful and some of the people I work with kind of drive me a little batty occasionally and I I don't know if it I don't really know if that it causes my blood pressure to go up or not but it certainly could I guess
P2	so there's some stressors at work
P1	yeah
P2	and if it's okay I'm going to write down some of these things that as we talk through them so what else can affect blood pressure that you know of
P1	um well you know just mostly from watching TV shows I guess I am aware that alcohol and I drink some a moment that alcohol has some effect on blood pressure I think it might even say so on the label though I'm not sure
P2	it can't it can't anything else you can think of
P1	no
P2	well sometimes sometimes weight can be an issue and explain this little tool to you this is for what it's worth called a agenda mapping so it sounds like there's a number of things that you know of and then we can talk about that affect your blood pressure you mentioned stress and an alcohol and we talked about weight certainly you know blood pressure medication can affect you there and I would say another big one might be exercise does all that makes sense
P1	well yeah
P2	so we could we can talk about a lot of these things with which one might you want to talk about and if we need to we can set up for appointment and talk about this more if we run out of time but
P1	well um exercise I'm I actually like to exercise
P2	and tell me about the exercise that you're doing
P1	well I play golf and walk the golf course
P2	so you carry your bag or do I drag it along on a pull cart
P1	my wife says that that doesn't count as exercise but I say try it yourself it is exercise
P2	it is exercise it is exercise Michael look at your your weight when we came in
P1	yeah
P2	and you were about 160 or so yeah which is actually according to your BMI body mass index in the in the overweight range how do you feel about that
P1	well I don't think I'm overweight
P2	yeah you don't look terribly overweight but according to the the charts there it's in the overweight category so you're actually getting you into the normal category would be about a loss of about 15 to 20 pounds
P1	15 or 20 pounds
P2	yes 15 or 20 pounds
P1	I haven't weighed that since I was in high school
P2	I understand I understand but you know I'm not saying that we need to lose 20 pounds sometimes just a loss of 10 pounds can make a tremendous impact on your on your blood pressure
P1	okay
P2	so 10 pounds sounds like something that might be negotiable
P1	5
P2	5 is the number
P1	okay
P2	let's go you do with thigh
P1	okay I think I can do 5
P2	all right so if you were to want to lose 5 pounds how would you go about it
P1	I'd probably go back to the gym
P2	as that worked in the past
P1	yeah I mean I used to go to the gym and work out a lot and uh I've done it for a while but I guess if if I'm I'm sure I could lose 5 pounds if I wanted to
P2	and that would actually kind of take care of two of these things right your weight and your exercise both of those would have a really positive effect I think on your on your blood pressure
P1	okay well
P2	so we've talked about changing your medication stopping the medication you're on changing you to this ACE inhibitor and then perhaps looking at the weight and going getting back to the gym and starting an exercise program is that about right
P1	well what would it take for me to not have to take the medication at all
P2	at all
P1	yeah I mean if I did enough exercise and lost enough weight would you not what I not need to take the medicine
P2	I I really wonder if you would I think that's an excellent question and if you're motivated to lose that kind of weight I'm with you I can't leave I this good I can lose five pounds well it may it may take more than five pounds to get the desired effect on your blood pressure that's really getting back down into that normal weight range if you will in that one 35 to 40 range probably
P1	I I just want to make sure I understand if I if if I lose uh five pounds and I do it through exercise that I could you would recommend that I try going without the medicine for a while too and see what happens
P2	I don't think I'm ready to go there yet Michael but it sounds to me like you want to get off of your medication
P1	yeah if I can yeah
P2	well it there it's a blood pressure rate that you are right now blood pressure number that you are right now I probably wouldn't recommend that that that's going to take a plan for us to work out over probably a period of months so that you could one lose a little bit more weight to exercise really regularly we might want to talk about the alcohol um can I ask you how much your you're drinking now our regular basis
P1	two or three beers a day
P2	two or three
P1	yeah
P2	it is okay I'd like to share with you a little bit of information about alcohol and its effect on blood pressure Merryn research has shown that for men more than two drinks a day and for what more than one drink a day really can significantly impact your blood pressure negatively it raises blood pressure how does that how does that sit with you
P1	you're saying two or three
P2	more than two more than three
P1	okay so two is still considered aa safe and regard to blood pressure
P2	that's what most of the research shows
P1	okay I'll do two
P2	you'll do two okay and you said that you did two three every day
P1	most every day yeah sometimes a little more on the weekend I guess
P2	can you think of any ways to maybe cut back on that to where you wouldn't be getting as much alcohol in your system on a regular basis
P1	oh yeah I guess I could you know I mean uh I you know I don't I I don't have a drinking problem so I could take a day or two and not drink at all if but if if two a day doesn't hurt my blood pressure um I think I could go with that
P2	so two a day um keep in mind too there are significant amounts of calories involved and alcohol particularly beer
P1	I suppose I could drink Light beer
P2	light beer doesn't appeal to you
P1	might as well not drink beer at all you drink Light beer but I suppose if I suppose I could do that
P2	scale of zero to ten zero being not willing at all to do that ten being very willing to do that where do you think you
P1	probably about it I
P2	why did you say a five and not a three or four
P1	just because uh you know doc habits are hard to break you know and it usually don't drink Light beer and so it would be a change it would be something different but uh well you know I'm willing to give it a try
P2	tell me the good things about cutting back on alcohol and maybe switching to light beer talking about the good things
P1	well I did you know obviously a good thing is I'd probably lose weight which is what we're trying to do here
P2	so you'd lose weight
P1	uh and there there may be other things about alcohol that has something to do with blood pressure that I did not understand but but I suppose it would help keep my blood pressure down and my weight low or if I didn't drink as much beer or if I drank light beer and so that's the good side the bad side is I don't like it as much
P2	on a scale of zero to ten zero being not very important and ten being very important how important is it for you to to get better control of your blood pressure
P1	very important I put that up really pretty high I'll give that a nine
P2	so in terms of making a change what are some of the things that you'd be willing to do in order to make that happen
P1	well you know I'm willing to do the things but most of what we've just talked about
P2	which are
P1	um drinking Light beer drinking no more than two beers a day going to the gym again and sticking with a different medicine for a while
P2	okay so to recap changing your medication you're willing to go to the gym and exercise switch to light beer and keep the beer to a maximum of two a day okay now only you can make that decision Michael I can't do it for you is that somewhere that you're willing to go
P1	yeah I think I'm willing to do what it takes to keep my blood pressure at a level that doesn't concern me and if this is what it takes I'm going to give this a try
P2	so one more scale in terms of your readiness to make to do this zero being not ready at all and ten being ready where would you fall on that
P1	six and a half
P2	six and a half and watch six and a happen and not two or three
P1	because I know when I walk out of here that if I keep doing what I'm doing I I'm either going to have to live with the blood pressure medicine that takes all my energy away and I don't like that or I'm going to have to let my blood pleasure get real high and I know that can cause all sorts of bad things to happen
P2	so you're really worried again about the health consequences of not keeping your blood pressure under control
P1	people keep telling me that high blood pressure causes all sorts of bad things to happen so yes I am concerned about that
P2	so if it's okay I'm going to put this in your record that we talked about well we're certainly going to switch your medication but you're going to be working on losing some weight going back to the gym cutting down on your beer usage and switching to light beer is there anything I missed
P1	five pounds
P2	five pounds that's the number now I'd like to see you back and about let's call it a month let's see back in a month
P1	I'm the five pounds going by then
P2	my pounds will be gone and we'll see how things are going and probably talk about this some more and see how successful you've been with this plan and then we'll go from there
