None	come on
P1	hello Doctor okay
P2	how can I help you t well
P1	I would like a repeat prescription please for my diet drugs just confirm for me your name again
P1	Laura Smith up like yes yes I brought you
P2	Reducto I think that's what it was colleges and reduct I'll actually is no longer recommended and for usin in we lost weight control have you been getting on with it?
P1	and I know they're not losing weight but I'm not putting it on and just give me another one then I'm not fussy which makers I am
P2	you can buy em over the counter Laura doors lower doors tablets eat so you don't need a prescription for them anymore
P1	well I've know that my prescription cause my prescriptions fee and I think I've got a Rachel prescription and no
P2	I'm sorry we can't prescribe orlistat
P1	why and
P2	because it's over-the-counter medicines right
P1	so just give me the equivalent and counter is great
P2	we can't we can't prescribe anything reductil was the one that was on I was prescription on the medicine and we can no longer prescribe that guidance recommends that we no longer prescribe that for people because it's actually shown to increase the cardiovascular risk and actually I noticed from your last visit that your blood pressure was a little bit high I don't think you should be taking any medicines because the bottom line is actually from what you're telling me is it's not helping you to lose weight it's helping you to maintain your read and maintaining your weight should be something that you do through diet and exercise anyway this is artificially maintaining your weight
P1	find that really hard just keep piling on the pounds until I started a dragon you know I really would like it are you sure that it's yet dangerous because yes not that long ago that happen well
P2	it has actually been recent gaiden so in the last month or so after six weeks tips sometimes tease a bit to filter through but we've been told unequivocally that we're not allowed to prescribe this anymore your prescription to farm since they won't fill it and you really do need to be joining Weight Watchers there's been an article there's been an article in the in the BMG just a couple of weeks ago that shows are actually joining a group a Weight Watchers group or the equivalent is much more effective long-term well I'm sorry there's no choice yeah it's a much lower it's much more it because it's less there's less and drug in it it's less effective but then consequently it's also less dangerous so you can buy them orlistat and or you can join Weight Watchers you actually
P1	I don't think you're thinking about how stressed I am about my week I'm sorry it's not you I know I know and
P2	I can appreciate that what it's your diet and exercise that's the important thing you need to get yourself sorted out I don't eat them all well I think you might find that you possibly are eating more than you think and if you join Weight Watchers or equivalent slimming world etc then you possibly would be encouraged to do a food diet e and you might find that you're eating more than you there's nothing more I can do for you we cannot prescribe reductil anymore the recommendation is join a Weight Watchers group or Slimming World Group and just modify your diet and increase your exercise that is the only way that you are going to lose weight
P1	well I'm not really happy with that approach I'm really sorry that I was unable to help you because
P1	there must be somebody else in here that has got more and understanding approach to weight loss and telling me to join Weight Watchers
P2	well that is the recommendation that's the guidelines if you're very welcome to go and make an appointment with another doctor but you will get the same message from them as you're getting from me and I'm uh sorry if I peered unsympathetic however the bottom line is diet and exercise is what you need to do in order to lose weight and to maintain your weight
P1	but I am eating what I've always it's just know that I'm getting little age and piling on pounds so
P2	if you're on if you're on a stool that you've always done then you're always going to get what you get so if you already eat and you've already used to be fat but the only reason that you're maintaining your weight is because of the deductr
P1	if you would let me finish I've only started to get fat since I had the menopause so are you telling me that because I've had the menopause I'm not allowed to eat a normal amount of food
P2	no I'm saying that you need to be looking at your whole lifestyle which is dying exercise I'm really sorry that i'm unable to help you today please feel free to make an appointment with another GPA
P1	well i'll be taking this further because i'm not happy i'm not satisfied with this ok thank you
P2	thank you
