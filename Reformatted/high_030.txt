P2	great hello my name is Sara I'm the student pharmacist at what's a name and how can I help you
P1	you can comment miss trans I'm just having like a migraine today so I'm coming in hopefully you can make any recommendation for me I choke fatigue cold and tired
P2	all right when a scale one to ten how bad is your headache
P1	it's about seven
P2	oh I see you and a lot of pain right now
P1	yeah
P2	when did it start
P1	um it start a couple of hours ago and it's it's getting worse
P2	did you take any medications yet
P1	um no not not at all not at all
P2	so what makes it better and what makes it worse
P1	so if I'm exposed to allow noise and then light I tend to tend to get worse but then if I you know I'm going to a room and dark room and no light no without noise and I'm it's getting better but still I'm still having like a you know really bad migraine
P2	dude they do again those migraines select orphan
P1	um only once once in a while is very rare I'm not really often at all
P2	okay so before I recommend that medications to be and before I will I want you to ask you about your past medical history
P1	okay
P2	do you take any medications or do you have any medical conditions
P1	I I have diabetes so I'm currently taking metformin twice daily other than that I don't think I take any other medications at all alright
P2	alright do you smoke
P1	um I don't
P2	do you drink alcohol
P1	occasionally
P2	occasionally how much
P1	drink one drink like maybe what
P2	it's all right
P1	yeah
P2	no that's all right there's any allergies
P1	not that I know no
P2	okay so I will recommend medication this one it's called excedrin extra strength it has if the one tablet contains three different medications inside first one is acetaminophen it's a pain reliever and the second one is aspirin it's a pain reliever and it's also anti-inflammatory drug hours and also it contains caffeine
P1	okay
P2	and caffeine scanners constrict your blood vessels in your brain and also can relieve pain from from the migraine
P1	okay
P2	all right so this medication because of your your headache is very bad I would recommend you to take two terabytes
P1	okay
P2	by mouth every six hours but not more than eight tablets a day I say and you should not be taking this medication for more than 72 hours not more than three days and if you still feel the symptoms they're handing now after three days you should consult your doctor
P1	okay
P2	all right
P1	okay
P2	and the best way to take this medication is with water
P1	okay
P2	with a full glass of water and if you feel upset stomach you should take it with meals
P1	okay
P2	food okay
P1	okay
P2	usually this medication does not cause any major side effects however it make was obsessed Omikron or vomiting and you may feel a little bit nervous of shaking
P1	okay
P2	because of caffeine all right and then I would advise you not to drink any alcohol tourist medication because it may increase your risk for a stomach bleeding or a liver disease all right and you should not be taking any other medications over-the-counter like Tylenol or ibuprofen advil that personally don't take any of this because it already contains no aspirin okay because it contains a renter those products so you should not be taking too much of it and I would also advise you not to have too much coffee or caffeine in general
P1	okay
P2	all right because this product contains caffeine inside
P1	okay
P2	all right and also this medication does not have any drug interactions with your metformin so don't worry affect that's what I am concerned okay and you know so how so do we have any questions for me
P1	um so so I just take two tablets every six hours for the cost of water
P2	all right
P1	perfect thanks so much
P2	oh yeah oh you're welcome so you need any more help any questions you can always find me here
P1	okay perfect thank you
