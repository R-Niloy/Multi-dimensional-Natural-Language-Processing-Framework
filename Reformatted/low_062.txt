None	finded life a bit anxious making just am I'm I'm working full time my husband's abroad okay my child's just left to go to university and I'm doing an online course and I really feel as if everything's getting on top of me and I felt like this once before about three or four years ago you'll you'll have it in your records and and you give me some tablets and not just helped me just get over the hump and I'm really thinking that I need some medication
P2	okay let's see your records that be sorry about two years ago roughly?
P1	yes that would be about right yes and
P2	do remember the name of you tablets you got them?
P1	valium
P2	let's see it yeah you got  tablets at that point
P1	yes yes and that was enough I didn't need any more than I just helped me get over the hump I'm just I just I'm feeling tearful and I don't feel able to get moving motivated and things are slipping and I'm just just a bad day yeah Jess I just feel anxious
P2	but you're working now is that right?
P1	i guess i'm working now mmhmm yeah
P2	is ok?
P1	yeah ever since fine at work uh-huh yeah i know what's key i enjoy but obviously it's because i'm feeling a bit i feel as if things are getting on top of me at work a little bit but it's not really i know this noise just that we are feeling okay
P2	you're sleeping well?
P1	i'll wake up harrell in the morning and I don't seem to be able to get back to sleep or go to sleep okay at night but wake up hell in the morning edge or soon to be able to get back to sleep very quickly okay
P2	you eating fine concentrations good core memory is good?
P1	Constitution could be a bit better my memory getting older you know my memory to schools a little bit but other than that normal really just feeling just I'm worried about things I'm worried about my daughter she left home and you know worried about all of that and my husband's abroad and you know this online courses drive me and scene but I know that I know that when I'm on for him and when I'm not just feeling so overburdened I'm fine
P2	is that why you're not looking after yourself as well at the moment?
P1	I am looking after myself I'm eaten quite healthily I just struggled to get sleep I guess sleep okay and I wake up in the morning I mine's going nuts
P2	and alcohol?
P1	I have a couple of glasses at Wayne at night just helps me get off to sleep
P2	with glasses how much do you mean?
P1	and maybe about  mils in a glass that reasonably smallish classes yeah
P2	two of those? yeah okay and you wanting tablets?
P1	yes that helped me the last time and that's what I want
P2	we've no Rini to follow guidelines and recommendations on how they've had just had recently updated guidelines we use things like nice guidelines and stuff and you're describing anxiety symptoms that seem to be related to specific issues and we don't think tablets are the best thing anymore we're there's much more recommendation to big you know talking with professionals having what we call CBT cognitive behavioral therapy working through these issues is probably a better long-term option and is what is firstly recommended and second recommendation we try and avoid especially those types of drugs you're talking about valium because we know they just make addicted to them
P1	ah so what about this did you see cognitive cbt cbt what does that mean
P2	it's a psychologist to talk to you about you how things you do
P1	how long does it take well
P2	it's usually our obsessions in a seminar if you're lucky once a week that week wicked
P1	I don't have time to do I wear long sessions once a week I'm working full time and I'm doing an online course and I've still got a house to manage I just would prepare the tablets work for me before I would prefer that I got
P2	you don't have anyone any of them left yet still we finished all those you had? C	two years ago yes yep she took all than one then when I needed them yet and that was fine that was all I needed though you gave me I think  tablets that was all I needed just to get me over the hump nope just about - weeks
P2	still think be worth having a more in-depth discussion about this to see what would be your best options because I other tablets as well that can be used again there again more preventative it's more to keep these things getting so it doesn't happen again and again and again right and also your ways of coping assume does it
P1	how long is it if you get referred for cbt how long does it take to be seen
P2	it depends a bit on different areas where is it you live just locally here don't you yeah i would have to send a letter and we would get a reply to tell us how long you'd have to wait and i would hope it would be too long because this is one of our prioritized areas and it how long is too long what i should be within the month i would take a month yeah
P1	i could get tablets and be fixed in a month yeah so you're saying i can't get tablets
P2	well i definitely when you give you that many and i really think you'll be worth looking at the other options how about i gave you just a few like a couple to see if that does you a little better than it
P1	and then i have to come back when I'm finished in and go through this whole conversation again
P2	no I think no I think we should refer your straightaway
P1	right so no tablets you've gone from
P2	I'll give you a few tablets I'll give you a few tablet and we'll refer you because I need you don't have to come back here unless there is a problem
P1	but you're seeing that a Pharaoh's going to take a month and you're going to give me a few tablets I can i'll be back here next week seen can have some more tablets then
P2	do you think it's going to last that long?
P1	as if it's good like  tell that's the last time and it took the  tablets to help me get myself sorted out so yes i do i just think this is ridiculous changes are more for changes but it worked what if it works like like oh it's just we know the damage
P2	i can do you affect your driving light over they dictate just as a short bar so it was won by suppose if that's your day I'm saying well I think you know that beam in between we can give you a couple of times now to try for the next few days I'll send a referral today and obviously if you feel so better you can come back but I would hope you wouldn't need to ask okay let just to do check here as well computers reminding me that you ever do you smear as well that we will as well yep you know we have targets we need to read targets yeah so worth getting them done
P1	but I you sure your records are right i'm pretty sure i had last me or less than a year ago
P2	was that somewhere else then? because that might not be recorded here no is good something here
P1	this is my plant assistant single you can ask me about my blood pressure names don't you
P2	that was done we need to do that every three or five years I've got that has been done that's okay and for the smear it's not being recorded here did you get a letter with the result? if you do member we could be good records that way no it's not going to do any harm getting an extra one so make the point with the nurse right the time the
P2	I will get that done as well so everything is up to date
P2	okay i'll just write the description
P1	okay thank you sir okay
P2	thank you see you
