P2	now before I go into more detail about this medication what concerns do you have that you'd like me to address with you here today
P1	honestly the the pain in my legs I'm a landscaper so it made it so that I couldn't work so I mean that's my biggest concern the doctor said you know that it would help to be on this and
P2	certainly I understand that and hopefully you won't have the same issues with this one I will talk about that before I get to that though what did your doctor say this medication is used for
P1	lower cholesterol you know something about triglycerides
P2	we see this a lot with lowering cholesterol especially triglycerides which are a type of cholesterol
P1	okay
P2	now how did your doctor tell you that you're going to use this medication
P1	twice a day
P2	twice a day so you'll take one tablet which is 600 milligrams and just like it says on here it's actually two tablets so you'll be taking a total of 1200 milligrams and you'll be doing that by mouth twice a day so the best time to take it is about a half hour before breakfast and then again a half hour before dinner if you can remember that

P2	hopefully it will now it's still possible it may cause that you are in kind of a high dose most people do fine on it I mean it's a different it works in a different way than the statin so if you experience that just let your doctor know but most people do do fine
