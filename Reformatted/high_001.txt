P2	hey Monica how are you doing today
P1	I'm okay right now but I'm a little anxious because thinking about how Black Friday is soon and my friends want to go to the mall for Black Friday but I really can't go and I want to go but I really to interesting
P2	so it sounds like you really want to go to Black Friday with your friends you're feeling a little anxious about it
P1	yeah Monaco but interesting but I was thinking about it and maybe if I could make an image or something that I could use while I'm there maybe I'd be able to go so I was wondering if I could give you that very well
P2	that sounds like a great idea can absolutely do that
P1	okay
P2	so we have some materials on the table but if you'd like to use anything else that we've used previously just let me know and I'll get them to you for you
P1	um do you have a Sharpie
P2	it do did you have a color that you wanted
P1	black maybe
P2	all right here
P1	this
P2	welcome
P1	ok I think I'm done
P2	all right is there anything you'd like to tell me about it
P1	well I'm sure um I drew mountains and lake because when I think about things like Unicom I think of nature so I drew a scene that I think would keep me calm
P2	so it sounds like nature and mountains are coming to you do you think that this will be helpful I'm black Franny
P1	yes as long as I can remember to think about this image when I'm there but maybe I'll bring it with me when I go so I can refer to it when I'm anxious
P2	that sounds like a great idea
