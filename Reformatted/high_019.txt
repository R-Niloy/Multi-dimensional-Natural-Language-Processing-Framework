P2	hi this is dr. Grande I hope you find this video useful if that's the case please like it and subscribe to my channel as always thanks for watching
P2	hello Pepe how you doing today
P1	okay how are you
P2	I'm good thanks for asking I understand you've come here today to the agency because you have a recent arrest
P1	yeah um I got a DUI for being under the influence of alcohol marijuana
P2	alcohol marijuana how recently was this DUI
P1	Um about a week ago
P2	okay so what's been going on what is gonna happen
P1	um well I am gonna have to go to court soon and I know that I'm probably gonna have to get some type of like treatment or something like that but I really just don't want to so I just I'm just coming here because I don't know maybe I can like get out of it if I'm getting some type of treatment but I don't know
P2	get out of it you mean gonna have the charge
P1	yeah I mean I feel like they're probably gonna make me like go to rehab or something like that I want to do that
P2	so you feel like you can get out of the rehab part too-
P1	um I don't know I really am Not sure I just know that I don't know getting in getting the DUI is kind of just made me realize I like me to make it change but I'm just not ready to stop drinking or using marijuana there's just like the only things that like really help me in my life
P2	all right so with this recent arrest you realize it may be about you to stop using but really don't want to
P1	mm-hmm yeah
P2	so you're stuck there
P1	yeah it kind of like I would like realized that like drinking and using marijuana hasn't like got me anywhere positive really but it's like the only thing that like I know I just that's all I do usually and it's all in that mix we ever like feel better
P2	when you drink do you ever socialize at the same time
P1	I mean sometimes I'll like go to bars and things like that but most of the times just like that I am at my house
P2	alone safety of the marijuana
P1	yeah I mean I'd like a few people that always smoke with but usually just kinda by myself I mean I smoke every day so thought it was with people I'm doing it
P2	so doesn't sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using
P1	no not really
P2	what are you losing
P1	I kind of just like use it to like cope I got like I have a brain injury that I got like a while ago like it still causes pain and that's just the only thing that ever seemed to help once after the injury
P2	this is the alcohol in there one
P1	mm-hmm
P2	so you take it for pain relief equalities
P1	yeah
P2	any other reasons
P1	um it's just easier it's just the marijuana like relaxes me it's just easier to kind of like forget about things when I'm using
P2	like forget about problems
P1	yeah
P2	so it affects your mood in a positive way
P1	yeah like I get like I'd like the feeling once I'm drunk and then if I'm feeling like anxious or anything like that like the marijuana helps with that so then just it's easier to like I don't feel anything so I don't have to worry I don't have to deal with any negative feelings
P2	have you used since you had the DUI
P1	um I haven't drank but I've smoked like I've cut back on my smoking a little bit but I'm still using
P2	alright it's been a bit of a situation all right so you have the use takes away pain for you it takes away anxiety feels good but then you have these consequences of the law
P1	yeah
P2	how do you figure those two things out
P1	I don't know I don't know if there's a way to figure both of my I just know like not I just couldn't imagine not drinking you not using marijuana he had imagined it
P2	all right so you can't imagine that so was it at the other side can you imagine having further incensed with law enforcement more charges in the future
P1	um I guess I hadn't really considered that I mean that I don't want there today I guess I would want this to kind of like go as smoothly as possible not get any more charges or anything like that not be in this situation again
P2	so you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not I really have a consequence and you'll be more careful in the future
P1	Um I don't know yeah I guess so I guess I probably just wouldn't drive if I like was just turning like right before try to like avoid that situation again
P2	so with that thinking you could continue to use as you were that you would take out the part that got you in trouble
P1	yeah
P2	the first you have to get out of trouble this time
P1	yep
P2	so if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it
P1	I just couldn't imagine getting to a place where that wasn't what was like helping me and then to like I don't I drink mostly by myself but I couldn't imagine like if my friends called me up and said hey do you want to go out tonight like not drinking with them
P2	so there is a social component here
P1	yeah a little bit I drink mainly by myself just because all my friends work like 95 jobs they don't drink every day but I do but like on the weekends and things like all of my friends who I do have they all do drink all right
P2	so you know if you had no anxiety no pain you'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends how would they respond if you went out with them and didn't drink
P1	um they probably just like wouldn't understand it because we all go out when we got like really drunken I would just feel like out of place
P2	so it'd be socially awkward
P1	yeah
P2	straining the relationships with your friends
P1	mm-hmm
P2	so the quitting and alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good route for you
P1	No not at all
P2	but then you have this this recent situation which is making you second-guess some of it
P1	yeah I mean it's making me think that like maybe I I need to like make a change I just can't see that that's the change I'm making
P2	so you need to make some change
P1	yeah
P2	but not the alcohol and drugs
P1	yeah
P2	something else could change
P1	yeah I don't know what
P2	you have any theories
P1	I mean I just thinking like just like cutting back on it and like not drinking and driving obviously because that's what like got me into this situation don't like other than that really and I really have really thought of what I could do
P2	so you could reduce your usage avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety in the pain
P1	I don't know it might just not go anywhere ever right not sure drive is often
P2	mmm
P1	because I don't know if I would if I'd be able to cut back drinking enough to like not have to like feel okay
P2	hmm so that strategy might not work
P1	I guess not
P2	that's something you've been tossing around though this idea of isolating a little bit more and drinking a little less seems like all your options here kind of grim
P1	yeah
P2	is that just is that just me or does it seem that way to you to
P1	now that I'm like talking through it yeah and I don't think I have any choice really
P2	you don't have any choice what's gonna happen it's going to happen
P1	I don't know
P2	all right so let's start with early know or pick up with what we know you don't want to make a bad impression in this whole court proceeding with the DUI what do you think you could do that would make a bad person
P1	Um go to court wrong test positive if I get drug tested
P2	That would do it
P1	I would do it get another DUI in the meantime
P2	that wouldn't look good either all right so you want to avoid those behaviors for sure so you know for sure you don't want it those things would it be acceptable to do those things
P1	I mean not really I mean I think I could avoid the nollie drunk-driving enough or maybe not to drank the day of my court date but I don't know about the whole you marijuana part
P2	that's tougher
P1	yeah
P2	all right so would you appreciate those as goals like avoiding those situations like going in the court drunk
P1	yeah
P2	goals that you could get behind
P1	um I mean I can try I guess so like think about it and try to get out there I know I'm gonna be stressed out the day of my court dates are it's gonna be hard to like not drink that day
P2	you're not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea
P1	No I am not
P2	this is really tough for you the alcohol
P1	um
P2	the marijuana that are important to you
P1	yeah
P2	this whole DUI thing  it's really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed
P1	yeah
P2	so is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life event that does change things
P1	Um I don't know because I don't know any other like way around it than just dealing with it I mean if I like don't go to court or anything that's gonna warrant out for me like I can't I can't avoid this situation
P2	what if as a condition of your treatment the judge says no more drinking in no more marijuana period legacy to that you obey those rules or or jail
P1	I don't know if it would I get to that I know it possibly could that probably will but I I don't know
P2	I would think it almost certainly would have
P1	yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't imagine like not drinking and using drugs I'm sure I would like leave court that day thinking I would but I don't know what happened when I get home for the next day or that day
P2	let's go back a couple of steps how long have you been using the alcohol marijuana
P1	for about like six years
P2	six years
P2	have you ever until now with the DUI have you ever envisioned stopping
P1	no
P2	what's your plan like what pre DUI well is your plan in all this
P1	I just I did like the jerking kind of has gotten worse it wasn't always that bad I've always used marijuana but the alcohol is I guess I've been using a little bit more recently so I didn't really ever have a plan the marijuana never really looked affected my life too much but I guess the alcohol has been a little bit more
P2	yeah so without this or something you would have continued using yeah for years to come
P1	yeah I didn't really have any like I never like thought I want to stop doing this or anything like that or had a reason to or
P2	till now
P1	yeah
P2	could this be in a strange way like an opportunity
P1	I mean I guess if I had if I wanted to stop this would be a way for me to stop or a reason for me to stop
P2	if you really wanted to stop could you stop
P1	I don't know may I guess I could try but I don't have that one
P2	you could give it a shot you're just not sure you could you could actually do it
P1	yeah I mean I've never tried to before so I don't know
P2	it's just unknown
P1	yeah yeah
P2	so where do you want to go from here you have this DUI I imagine a hearing or some type coming up right here to see me what can I do to help you
P1	um I guess yes help me figure out whether or not like I do want to stop drinking or using drugs I mean that might be something that I have to do right now I don't really want to so I don't know if I could like get to a place where I actually do want to stop it'd be easier to actually do it then
P2	like a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality
P1	yeah
P2	okay do you want to work on that
P1	yeah
P2	all right so between now I'm going to see again do you have any hearings or anything coming up
P1	no they're not for like a few more weeks
P2	a few more weeks so I'll see you again I know you have the IOP and everything here I'll see you again in a week and let's pick up with that anything changes we're hearing is moved up just snubby now
P1	okay
P2	thanks Pepe
P1	thank you
