None	were hoping to discuss today the pain in my ribs is still too much for me every time every time I take a deep breath or even just bend down to know feed my dog or something it's miserable
P2	sounds like you've been in a lot of pain and it's made it pretty difficult to do some of the things you normally do so tell me a little bit about your routine and and what your pain is like
P1	well I used to be able to go outside no jog around I play some sports and my friends every so often but I can't do anything now besides just lay in my bed
P2	sounds like you're really acted before and this pain is really causing a lot of problems for you if you would rate your pain on a scale of  to  where would you say your level is
P1	on average seven and eight usually sometimes less sometimes more
P2	okay so pretty high levels of pain
P1	yeah and nothing makes it better except when I take oxy and smoke some weed
P2	what kinds of things have you been doing to manage your pain
P1	oh that's taking the oxy you prescribed and smoking some weed you know every now and then again to just ease the pain
P2	okay so you you're taking the oxy you're smoking some weed can you tell me a little bit how you been taking your medications and how often you're smoking
P1	I mean I'm taking the oxy just as you prescribed one every four hours just the bottle says smoke weed maybe three or four times a day just take the edge off what other kinds of things have you been trying to manage your pain right now there was the hot and cold treatment but I just felt like a waste of time so did the topical cream is just a waste of money
P2	ok so the hot and cold didn't seem to work the topical cream didn't seem to work and it sounds like you've been taking the axion smoking some weed and that's been a little bit helpful tell me what else you've tried for your pain nothing else besides that really like
P1	i said the oxy and the weed it's hard for me to it was hard for me to even to walk here
P2	now i'm curious if you had a magic wand and you were able to wake up tomorrow and your life was different what would it look like
P1	I'd be outside again playing sports and my friends just enjoying life getting back to the things that just haven't been able to do
P2	Steven I think those are really great goals and I think those are things we need to be working towards and as your doctor I also need to share with you that I'm concerned that you're still on the oxycodone six months out from your injury six months really isn't that long
P1	and i'm still in pain and I mean if I wasn't in pain I wouldn't be taking it you know it's your it's your prescription I don't I don't know what else to do I need relief
P2	well I'm not trying to push you but I do think it's important for us to think about pain management that is not going to cause you more problems and it's going to allow you to get back to the lifestyle that you really want to be living what kinds of things do you think would be helpful
P1	I really don't know I am out of ideas
P2	okay
P1	it's not my fault I'm in this much pain you should have known if I was going to get addicted
P2	why didn't you tell me
P1	well and I'm sorry
P2	Stephen I don't mean to be pushing you but I do want to talk about maybe what the the next steps would be to be helpful for you
P1	well if you have any recommendations i'd be willing to hear
P2	i think it's really important that we choose a plan that you feel like you're able to do that works with you and you feel capable of following through with now thinking about what you've done already what do you feel like would be helpful at this point
P1	really anything that keeps me out of the pain I mean would you have any recommendations I'd be glad to hear them
P2	great i do i'd actually love to share some information with you from the Center for Disease Control they have some guidelines about how we approach pain management in situations like this would it be okay if I talk with you about that
P1	yeah yes okay
P2	so what the the guidelines do say is that for people who have had injuries like yours but we want to be using prescription pain medications in a certain period of time where it's effective and that tends to be six weeks so we're beyond that at this point now from that point what we like to do is transition you to over-the-counter medication so taper off the oxy and go to things like tylenol a leave and motrin and do that in combination with some holistic therapies like we've talked about before you know when people are on the oxy for longer than six months we put you at risk for some opiate dependence and some other health concerns
P1	I think that what would make sense
P2	at this point is to think about transitioning you off of the oxy onto one of these over-the-counter medications and using some of these other techniques to help you manage the pain what do you think about those guidelines and maybe that plan
P1	I I could agree with them it's just this holistic therapies you talked about require a lot of movement and without that pain relief i don't know how i would get through it
P2	yeah i hear that it's scary to to maybe do anything that might increase your pain that makes a lot of sense and i'm not opposed to prescribing you some some other medications for pain but as your medical provider i also have to say that I don't think smoking marijuana is the best means to manage your pain right now and I'm wondering what you think about making some of these changes
P1	yeah i'd be willing to try anything to get rid of this pain if you really think that's the best option then i will listen to you
P2	i do and i think we need to think about what you're willing to do what you're able to do and what you feel like you can do most consistently so it sounds like at this point we're thinking about tapering off the oxy getting you on to something like tylenol and doing some exercise that you feel like you can do how do you feel about this plan
P1	i'd be willing to try the holistic exercises you were talking about taking tylenol but if I'm in pain that I'm going to call you absolutely
P2	and I want you to call me and I think it actually makes sense for us to set a time within the next week for us to talk maybe do a phone check in and see how you're doing and even if you're not doing any better and then we can take it from there and see what changes we need to make to the plan
P1	great
P2	well I have to say I'm really glad that you came in and I think it's very courageous to take the step and facing some of this pain as well to get you back to the life that you really want to be living right now so I thank you for coming in and I'll see you I'll
