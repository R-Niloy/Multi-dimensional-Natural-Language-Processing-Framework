P2	well Jim I'm glad you're here I'm kind of surprised to see you're coming back today
P1	well I'll tell you one thing I sit out in front here for about an hour before I come in and that was about that that close just cranking that pickup up and heading back home I'll let you know just like I told rich I'm not real happy about being here I hope you understand that
P2	I'm hearing you loud and clear that being here is not something that's really a high priority for you
P1	and like an etching you got blond hair you know I haven't had a lot of luck with blonde hair last couple of weeks
P2	is alright well tell me a little bit more about that
P1	well I got assigned a probation officer and she's blond-headed gal
P2	mm-hmm
P1	and I think she's out to just destroy me totally you know she's she's talking about me getting a lot of jail time this big fine and everything that she's gonna do if I don't do certain things and I just kind of think maybe you're gonna do the same thing to me
P2	so it seems to you like I might try to push you around and make it do a whole bunch of things you don't want to do
P1	yeah and you know I'm I'm about up to here with this kind of stuff oh I hope you know that probably isn't your fault but I just kind of way things been going
P2	you're pretty fed up
P1	yeah my daughter you know she well let me see the kids
P2	your grandchildren what's that about
P1	well she'll let me see him but she won't let me take him anywhere anymore
P2	really
P1	and and that really has me upset you know she's afraid that all I'll take him hurt him driving around drunk drinking and driving things like that and I never have heard one of them kids hmm
P2	so she's afraid that if you take the children with you that you'll be drinking and then you might hurt them or
P1	get a name and I say that a Dowlen I one drink she still don't trust me now and that's really got me upset nearly got me ticked off
P2	so the fact that your daughter won't even take your word for the fact that you won't drink kind of bites at you a little bit
P1	and she said yeah why you need help well you know when she needed help I damn sure didn't put any kind of conditional you know and and I'm gonna tell she means I need help you know she I've always built around I was helped her financial she needs kids watching anything she needs old daddy's always giving it to her and I don't know where she get my list from this is really
P2	what does she say to you about her concerns
P1	well she says she's fraid dead you know I'll do something that hurt the kids
P2	uh-huh
P1	but I never didn't kids and never have in my life than to thank her
P2	kind of a mystery to you why she'd even be worried about that
P1	ever since my wife moved out I think she's just taking an attitude with my wife you know that she's siding with her for some reason you know up and up until my wife moved out thanks for going party get your moment we're not divorced but my wife is it's kind of upset at me also feyza she moved out a couple three months ago
P2	do you kind of have the feeling that your wife and daughter are ganging up against you
P1	it feels that way I don't know if it you know if that's true but I just kind of feel like well why they called once they get you down everybody jumps on that's the way I feel now you know that the since that DWI and car wreck and everything and my wife's left from the daughters you know raising Cain with me now probation officers one that to eat my lunch put me in jail you know break me financially and things like my my boss is all but said if I if I lose my driver's license my have a job there I've got about three more years to go before retire so a lot of what what I'm doing here you know or why I'm coming here the only reason I'm coming here is so that I can maybe save my driver's license I won't lose my job so I won't lose my house it's not because I'm gonna do any of this crap
P2	yeah you're not here because you think you have a problem you're here because they sent you here
P1	yeah corp sent me here
P2	and that's the only reason you're here
P1	yeah I'll be honest with you there's no need me lying to you because I don't unless you go down and tell the court that you know I did you know I'm not motivated to be here or anything but I I don't like any of this I'll be honest with you no it's taken a lot of time that I don't have to take a lot of money that I don't have you know for the court and the fines and all this stuff now on top of that I've got to pay my lawyer $1
