None	it's a good morning my name is Jane
P1	yeah um I'm Michelle
P2	okay so i'll be your additional therapist today and the doctor recently told you the UH pre-diabetes and I wanted to get your reaction to this news so that I can better help
P1	um well I mean I wasn't really expecting this it really caught me off guard and I know what I eat isn't always the healthiest you know um but I didn't think things were this bad I mean my life is pretty hectic so I guess I haven't really been taking care of myself so yeah
P2	so you were pretty shocked and I'm sensing you might be quite scared too
P1	yeah I'm a little scared but more worried than anything I mean my career is really important to me and I don't really want my pre-diabetes tummy down and um I don't really want to have to take medication you know as who does I'm absolutely terrified of needles so I don't want to be pricking myself all the time and then watching what I eat and counting car I dress and everything it just sounds like a whole lot of hassle that I don't have time for it you know
P2	you feel like having diabetes will cause some unfortunate lifestyle changes what I'm hearing says you don't want your bad health to affect the way to affect your career
P1	mm-hmm basically I guess FF is so much a mark that I've kind of gotten to take care of myself and um I guess I'm really shooting myself in the foot because that's what's cosmic pre-diabetes you know um
P2	so you feel like you're just not giving the attention your body really deserves
P1	yeah and honestly haven't been this way like when I took this job I guess that's when my health started spiraling downwards and I don't know I guess that's when I kind of noticed things were kind of off as far as my health goes so
P2	can you tell me a little bit more about what you do?
P1	um well I'm an ESL teacher so I teach English to foreign students and adults I work in a community center close by but I also spend a lot of my days traveling it's just part of the job so I eat out often and always on ago and it makes following a healthy diet and lifestyle pretty difficult and and I mean I know exercise and diet report I guess I honestly could work out at the gym at the hotels but they aren't always available you know
P2	okay so you recognize the importance of exercise
P1	yeah I do um but when i get that free time i just want to veg out you know you don't really want to have to come back and go to the gym you know so that's part of it too
P2	so yeah I think that you should make exercise a part of your life um exercise is huge and managing your diabetes if you're overweight it can help you lose weight exercise can also help with your blood sugar and it can also reduce your stress levels
P1	um well I guess I mean it could be a way for me to avoid getting diabetes and yes taking medication
P2	I think yeah I think exercise is the right step for you to stop the progression of your diabetes um so how many days a week do you think you can exercise?
P1	um I mean right now I just want to say one because you know when I travel I'm not really sure if there's ever going to be anything available and um I don't know I'd like I don't even like exercise in words so it would be a big step a big change for me
P2	can you make it a goal to exercise three to four times a week? I need you to do it more than just one day
P1	um I mean that might just be a little too much for me honestly I mean maybe when I'm stuck in a hotel and they have a gym i'm just unsure as whether i can commit to doing that much because I mean I don't want to buy gym membership here because i'm not home enough to use it and I feel like it would just be a waste of money no
P2	I really think that making exercise important part of your wife is crucial for you
P1	yeah but I mean I just I don't know it's just difficult for me you know like I said I don't enjoy it to begin with so it would be a really big step
P2	I'll tell you what you should do I'll give you the name of my trainer just come in mention my name and he'll take care of you um his name is George this is this hot italian guy um he really makes working out a walk in the park so you'll go see him
P1	I mean maybe that might be something still don't know
P2	this will be great for you I'm being physically active is an essential part in the treatment of diabetes it will lower your blood sugar um body fat your body fat will decrease and you'll really feel so much better
P1	yeah I mean like I said we'll see
P2	well thanks for coming in today um I feel very confident about this exercise thing that will be successful next time you come in we'll look at the progress you made and it kind of increased the number of times that you're exercising a day
