P2	hi nice cute
P1	you two
P2	so why don't you tell a little bit about yourself
P1	so when it was Kelsey Harris I am a student here I'm a senior double majoring tiger balm on campus I play a sport I do collectivities home very busy around campus from with your lineup I was born and raised here so I like beyond my family a lot
P2	just sounds like you're really busy all the time yeah
P1	yeah you can say that you got home a lot
P2	um actually no not really I only live a couple hours away but my parents come here not frequently but enough that i get to see them so you say they play basketball
P1	yes
P2	yes
P1	yes so walgreens whopping two-year like what you decide
P2	well I've been struggling with some anxiety issues lately and I can't seem to figure out why I just I've been having some like anxiety attacks and panic attacks just wasn't like the last couple months and I thought him just go away on their own and like they think has come on at night sometimes or at first I thought they were centered around like papers and normal collops things but then like I had one were fall break whenever I didn't have anything to do looking to be here
P1	have you so you see that it has nothing to do with schoolwork because you said you have a really cool place and you don't think I hadn't anything to do it back
P2	I don't think into this and I mean it's a big school of constant thing so it's my senior year or two and I had to pop up until now so I I don't know I can't really figure out what could be causing it
P1	how are things at home with your family
P2	I'm dinner going well my little sister actually she's a freshman in college this year so my parents are at home with the emptiness and trying to figure out what i'm going to do with their free time and call me a lot i went off a lot but I mean everything's fine I see my grandparents pretty often my sister is going well
P1	that's good so so you and your family are going well
P2	we're we ever pretty close
P1	how I was like the social life like how are things at school you know with your friends and ball how are things going
P2	socially everything is going well too just trying to keep everything balanced it's a but I mean I feel like I'm doing a pretty good job of it
P1	you get very clean school and stuff
P2	yeah and i will say that senior year brings you know the senioritis around sometime so it's hard to get some motivation in there but um I mean schools would well like I I'm happy with my grades are socially I'd say that I mean my friends are still there like I love my friends I'm i feel like i do the same things that is nothing different going on
P1	okay
P2	socially I
P1	just just get anxiety attacks just randomly
P2	yeah
P1	do you notice any pattern maybe when things id attack occurs
P2	so I had probably five or six within the past month a couple of them happen at night only who actually most only the only one happy birthday but I wasn't like around anybody see any patterns with that at a loss
P1	but he had any strange or reoccurring dreams
P2	um actually I have they're just been like weird dreams that it's like I don't know it kind of plays on the future a lot but then like whenever i wake up i can't remember like specific details from it like you have you had a dream where you it feels so really you wake up and you Cameron really what just happened
P1	yeah that's usually how you know it works a lot of people put a note pad next to their their bed and the second they wake up they write down what they dreamt about so they don't forget and like it's just something that people do but maybe that's something that you can try oh my good yeah so you say your sister her brother
P2	sister
P1	just left home why she going to school
P2	she is in school at Spelman in Atlanta so she is having fun hopefully studying oh no she's not playing sports she just ran their students
P1	she's a regular student
P2	yeah
P1	you know how many thousand things on your plate like you did
P2	yeah I was I don't know cuz every time I talk to her she's like like they have a lot of going on down there Nixon is it Lana like it's my Burlington North Carolina so I talked to her I'm like when you ever study I don't really you know every time I talk to your do it comes you too jealous but we should
P1	yeah okay so when you have anxiety like wouldn't have these attacks like what are you feeling
P2	I feel like scared I feel almost like a pressure like I can't breathe you type of thing but more like a scared feeling
P1	do you feel helpless
P2	yeah
P1	yeah what do you thought
P2	well the first time it happened like I never had before so I didn't know what's going on and I was like in my room just about a little bit not doing anything in particular so the first time it really scared me and then you know it took me a few seconds just like started reading my guardian graduate and then a house wine so I think the more they happened I hope they will just call myself down and just keep going few minutes later and not think about it but I don't want them to keep all right well
P1	that's good that you're about to keep my calm yourself down and that's good have you talked to any of your friends about it
P2	no
P1	it's the first time you're talking about it
