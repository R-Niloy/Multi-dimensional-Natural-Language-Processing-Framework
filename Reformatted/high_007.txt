P2	hi Lucy nice to see you today how you been going
P1	yeah well thanks
P2	great I'm just fully get started has anything changed with your medical history since I last saw you like any new medications or serious operations
P1	No
P2	great and is anything maybe worrying you about your teeth or your gums today
P1	I think I might have a hole in my tooth
P2	oh no what makes you say that
P1	I can feel it with my tongue and it's a bit sensitive
P2	mmm well let's lie you back I'll pop some gloves on and we'll have a little look Lucy it definitely looks like you need a filling um I'd love to help you figure out why you've got this new hole in your tooth do you mind if I ask you a few questions so we can try and figure it out
P1	Yeah of course
P2	great well here's a risk assessment form it's just a few questions that might help us figure out what the problem might be
P2	great yeah it says here that you're drinking soft drinks in between meals what do you know about the effect of soft drinks on your teeth
P1	I know it's not good for them
P2	that's right um the bacteria in your mouth can use the soft drink to create acid that eats into the tooth surface and causes the holes the more that your teeth are coated in the sugar the more likely it is that you'll develop a hole did you know the one can of soft drink can have 10 teaspoons of sugar in it
P1	I didn't know that so I shouldn't have soft drinks at all I'm not sure I could do that
P2	yeah I understand it does sound like you're worried about getting holes in your teeth though there are a few options that you can do to help improve how you consume sugar would you like to hear about those
P1	well I don't like getting feelings so that would be great
P2	yeah probably drinking soft drink you could try drinking it all in one go instead of sipping on it or you could try drinking just at mealtimes instead of in between meals so does either of those sound like they might work for you
P1	yeah I mainly sort of drink soft drinks in between meals though maybe I could just have them with lunch and dinner
P2	great I'm in Romania to get a break from the sugar I sort of on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most how motivated do you feel you are to make this change
P1	I don't like getting feelings so an 8 or a 9
P2	great and you maybe have any ideas that you could implement to help you avoid having soft drinks in between meals
P1	I could carry a water bottle around with me
P2	great that's a really good strategy and waters great for you too umm you can also try chewing sugar-free gum I mean is that something you're interested in
P1	I might give the water bottle a try first
P2	okay cool well look I'll put a little note in your file and the next time I see you if it's okay I'll check how you're going with avoiding soft drinks between meals
P1	yeah that'd be fun and hopefully I won't have any holes next time
