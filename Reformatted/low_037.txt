None	I understand that your asthma symptoms have been just really out of control so we need to look at some of the ways that you can get healthy and not be back here again
P1	yeah I definitely don't want to come back here but the doc said Oscar my dog is connected to my asthma symptoms but the ridiculous part is I've had them for  years before and now it's a problem
P2	well you sound a bit surprise by that but I'm sure that you've see some of the material that that the clinic gave you about as with symptoms and managing your asthma and pets are a really big source of problems when that respect
P1	yeah let me just clarify I've seen the materials I have them I haven't read them all I've been doing is taking the medicine so I don't know that much about this
P2	well wait a second Sal what do you mean you you have...? if you as an you know to be informed about I'm just really taken aback by that because I understand from your chart that you have a young baby a new baby
P1	giancarlo yeah
P2	and you are very concerned about your health you want to be there for your baby and that you've already taken some steps you've almost quit smoking which is fantastic so the next step is to really deal with the dog deal with the pet I know it's it's gonna be hard to do that but there are always people who will adopt animals I'm sure that you have friends or family members
P1	ah this is a little too much weight now first of all giancarlo is taken care of that's fine he doesn't have no asthma from the dog it's just me I don't I knew that I'm worried about
P2	Sal it's you that I'm worried about okay the symptoms are worse you've had two or three major asthma attacks and do you appreciate how this is a risk to your life that there are some some adults with severe asthma who actually can die as a result of their symptoms it truly is something to take very very seriously I can't emphasize that enough
P1	so Oscars gonna make me die? he hasn't made me die in  years and the doctor saying oh I don't know if it's the stress the finance is the drinking so what are we doing saying Oscar could make me die I've had him for  years
P2	Sal what do you understand that what happened six years ago or ten years ago your asthma is progressively getting worse you know very well that the puffers the strength of the medication is getting higher and higher and there's only so much that can be done with medication alone you know this
P1	well they can keep giving me more medicine and give me the strongest one I'll keep Oscar
P2	so you're almost on the strongest one and if Oscar is that important to you then do you put Oscar higher than your baby than your wife like that makes no sense to me do you understand how important this is?
P1	I understand that I don't think you get my situation I've had this dog for  years so I'm not just gonna up and get him out of my house when I don't even know if that's the main thing
P1	okay
