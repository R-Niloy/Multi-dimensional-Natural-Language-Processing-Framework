None	okay David so why don't you take a rinse and how are you feeling
P1	hmm pretty good
P2	would you like to drag this out what do you think all that was fixed
P1	really nice
P2	yeah you got rid of that bed yes coloration it was there ya know like that it went well good excellent I did notice quite a lot of staining actually I'm wondering what are your thoughts about what might be related to that
P1	hmm well the usual suspects smoking wine coffee
P2	yeah all of the above any thoughts on considering quitting smoking at this time
P1	yeah I thought about it I'm just it's not my cup I just I hear from everybody and I've tried I've tried before didn't work I get it all the time okay and it's like Here I am one more person the next the next doctor who's saying you need to be
P2	David mm-hmm and I'm sorry that's not how I mean to come across it
P1	I I know I'm not an idiot and people know that smokers are you know how can you smoke today it's just not that easy to quit
P2	mm-hmm
P1	and if it was as easy as a doctor saying or or your partner saying I who wouldn't be happy I'd be a real fool not to do it it was gonna make it like that yeah I just hear it every day
P2	yeah and what's been your past experience with smoking tell me can you tell me a little bit about kind of how the role it plays in your life how long you've smoked
P1	we have smoked for  years since I was
P2	mm-hmm
P1	and quit a couple of times off and on twenties but you know it's been consistent and I can't see myself changing now mm-hmm no matter what kind of talk I get or what they come up with it sounds like almost you've tried a lot of things that are out there and it's not something I can work for me
P2	yeah yeah no
P1	yeah I know cold turkey is probably the only thing that's ever going to do it anybody that's done it myself in my group it's been cold turkey and then they fight it but it's my choice
P2	mm-hmm
P1	and I don't like lectures about it
P2	yeah and it really is your choice you're absolutely right that nobody has the right to tell you what to do can I ask if you were to if there was to be a situation where you decided I must quit what what would that situation be
P1	hard to tell because I've already had open-heart surgery that didn't do it mm-hmm prostate cancer that didn't do it right I don't know but I really don't know I just don't really want it
P2	mm-hmm so this is something that you you have to pretty much see yourself doing for
P1	yeah a while credit while yet
P2	yeah okay well I really appreciate you being willing to even talk about it and I get that right now this is not something that you want to pursue would it be okay if I brought it up in our next visit because I I know that you've said you don't want to lecture but on the other hand I am I am concerned
P1	okay I could go for that I I'm always open to something you know to listen as long as I don't talk to yes okay he could be options I had some I had my surgeon just go like you're like why do I even keep you as a patient hmm he's good though you were glad again as a doctor
P2	yeah yeah well and David honestly wherever you're at will work with it um and so thanks for thanks for taking a couple minutes and talking about smoking
P1	thanks doc okay
