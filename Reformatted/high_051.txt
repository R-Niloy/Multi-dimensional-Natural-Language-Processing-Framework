P2	so I noticed on your diary car that you have that you did cut
P1	yup
P2	okay so let's talk about that a little bit when what day did that happen on
P1	Tuesday
P2	Tuesday okay so where were you on Tuesday when you first had the thought that you wanted to cut
P1	where I usually always am at school
P2	that's well
P1	I was on my Walker and that stupid girl
P2	what was going on at your locker
P1	Melanie was talking about Tim my Tim my boyfriend and I know it was it was my Tim she was talking about I just wanted a puncher so bad
P2	okay see you were standing at your locker and you heard somebody say something about Tim that you didn't want to hear
P1	yeah she was talking about him and he had he didn't text me the night before so who knows what's going on
P2	what were you feeling right then
P1	so angry so angry
P2	on a scale of one to ten how angry would you say you were
P1	like a nine
P2	pretty angry then
P1	yeah
P2	what did you do like then you're at your locker what's the next thing you did after you heard it the
P1	next thing I did I slammed my locker and I walked down to the gym but what I wanted to do was push her or poncho
P2	so I know that the gym is usually the place where he cut because you said you can go behind the bleachers people don't usually see you there
P1	yeah
P2	okay so where between hearing the person talking about Tim and going to the gym where did you decide to cut because you said you were also feeling like punching somebody so there must have been a point where you decided I'm going to cut
P1	I think it was right after I slammed my locker and thought I can't punch her I'm gonna get in trouble I'm gonna go cut
P2	okay so that was when you decided to cut and you went down to the gym
P1	mm-hmm
P2	and what happened when you got there
P1	well nobody was there because gym class isn't in the morning so I knew that nobody was going to come in the gym so I went behind the bleachers
P2	what did you use to cut
P1	the pencil that I have always used
P2	to the same pencil as usual
P1	yeah
P2	the one with the the metal tip
P1	yeah
P2	okay that was a pencil that you were saying that you were going to get rid of
P1	yeah I know it's just it's it's my favorite pencil I I use it for school and I just it's my favorite pencil
P2	okay so you still had the pencil you got under the bleachers you say you were feeling angry still are you still on the scale of one to ten where were you when you got under the bleachers
P1	I was still let like I was still pretty high maybe like an eight and a half though because I I knew I I knew I was going to cut
P2	okay
P1	so it like came down a little bit
P2	what were you thinking at that point
P1	well I thought couple things I thought I'm glad I kept this pencil and that I'm just so pissed that I just want to cut so badly
P2	so you have your pencil where did you cut
P1	on my
P2	leg how many times
P1	three
P2	how deep did you cut where it was it deep enough that you needed a band-aid did you need more than a band-aid
P1	no I mean I guess I could have used a band-aid but I mean whatever
P2	but it wasn't so deep that you needed something more
P1	no
P2	okay right after you cut where were you on the scale of one to ten with your feeling with your anger like a
P1	3
P2	3 what were you thinking right afterwards
P1	that felt good I feel better and I'm going to have to talk to Michelle about this
P2	did that feeling last you for the rest of the day they're feeling better um yeah for the most part yeah did
P1	okay so that's what happened right afterwards
P2	mm-hmm
P1	later in the day what were you thinking about the cutting well
P2	I kind of forgot about it okay but then I just started thinking about it again right before bad and just feeling really guilty that I cut because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you and I just I mean I the night time I just I constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like I mean you know it's usually a pretty hard time
P1	I know net is a really difficult time for you
P2	it is everything seems worse at night
P1	yeah
P2	so you were thinking back it up back on it then and you were feeling guilty
P1	yeah
P2	sounds like you weren't feeling so good about it then as you were in the afternoon
P1	no not always seems to happen
P2	sounds like for you cutting works for a little while but it doesn't last
P1	yeah I guess so
P2	I know you've also been working on doing less cutting
P1	I've been doing pretty good
P2	you have you've been working really hard I'm just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you won't have those guilty feelings
P1	yeah maybe I mean those guilty feelings really suck
P2	okay so with the cutting it sounds like the point where you decided to cut at your locker what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim
P1	yeah because she's stupid
P2	okay it sounds like you're also already having a pretty bad day you said he hadn't called he hadn't been texting as much and that was on your mind
P1	yeah that's right
P2	so I'm wondering if at that point if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting
P1	okay
P2	that'll bring that anger from a nine down a little bit
P1	it's not going to bring it down all the way to a three though I'll tell you that much
P2	it might not but it'll bring it down a little bit maybe each thing you try brings it down a little bit more
P1	alright
P2	maybe there'll be things you'll feel good about later you won't have to worry about that guilty feeling coming back
P1	alright
P2	so the first thing is that pencil it sounds like it's comforting to have it
P1	yeah it is
P2	it also sounds like it's tempting what do you think about that
P1	I mean only if I am in the mood to cut it's tempting I'm
P2	having that pencil is going to make it harder to try other things and you've been talking about how you're really committed to not cutting any more or cutting less
P1	yeah I am
P2	sounds like that pencil standing in your way
P1	yeah maybe
P2	what do you think about getting rid of the pencil this time choosing a different favorite pencil but maybe you can't cut with
P1	I mean maybe only only if it's can be like a really cool pencil
P2	that way you can still have something that can be your favorite but which won't tempt you that'll make it easier to try the two things
P1	yeah
P2	okay what do you think our first thing should be what do you think you can try you just heard somebody say something you don't want to hear you're feeling pretty angry what can you do in that moment
P1	what I do a lot at home when my mom's bothering me and saying stuff I don't want to hear I put my headphones on
P2	do you have your headphones with you at school
P1	yeah they they actually they let me keep them on in school
P2	is that something you'd be willing to try next time
P1	I think so there's a there's a few songs that usually help me so I think so
P2	okay that sounds like a good one to try so we have headphones I need to come up with one more what do you think you'd like to try
P1	well I really like my teacher mrs. en so she seems to always kind of be there when I need to talk and her rooms kind of right down the hallway from my locker in the same hallway so I guess I could talk to her
P2	that sounds like a good option so that's our goal is to keep pushing cutting further down the list and to keep adding things that you're going to try first and you're right that the first thing you try might not bring you all the way down to a two or of three but it might bring you down a little bit and each thing you try might bring you down just a little bit more so you have to be willing to try a few things can you do that
P1	I can but I really want like a cooler pencil though like like a cooler pencil so I don't know maybe maybe we could go look for a pencil together
P2	I think that's a good idea
P1	okay I'd like that
P2	okay thank you for answering all my questions on this you did a great job with this chain and I know it wasn't easy
P1	yeah you're welcome
P2	let's go look for that pencil
