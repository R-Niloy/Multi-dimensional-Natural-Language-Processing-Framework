None	okay so why don't you have a rinse David. how are you feeling
P1	okay
P2	good here take a look see what you think that feeling and the colors okay? you know there is quite a lot of stainings so I'm just wondering about um some concerns about smoking possibly gonna get that a coffee tea yeah have you heard this before yeah mm-hmm so you know the smoking is going to be related not just to some of the other negative consequences you know physically it infects dental caries dental cavities
P1	yeah
P2	um healing yeah in your mouth okay
P1	sure so I heard it all I but I just want to get my teeth fixed
P2	yes and I really want to be helpful I really want to you know my commitment is to your oral health so there are lots of medications out there David that actually take away a lot of the cravings there they make winning song to my old things
P1	I did try it so like I did try it i just did the pills and they didn't work yeah it was a waste and a cause more side effects
P2	know it but David it's not a waste research hows that people take on average about seven tries before they quit smoking so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting
P1	or seven lectures along the road
P2	well I don't think I'm giving you a lecture it's really not what I meant I know
P1	I just feel that way I get really I get very defensive about when the brick because I get it from my family doc my cardiologist everybody is like I'm not a complete fool I am for smoking
P2	well there's there's a reason that other people are talking to quit no but as I said these medications so you've tried the medication you've been willing once then can I write you a prescription for the medication can we talk about how you could use it? because this is something that that's very important not just for your overall physical ha guess
P1	I got to really want to it things I've tried usually caused me more problems and they helped
P2	oh no the smoking is going to cause you more problems than the than anything else I can promise you that David the side effects from the medications are nothing compared to what can happen from the smoking like that's the I think thing to really consider
P1	okay low can I go now?
P2	I'm okay but you
P1	know i know it i know'd I know doc what you're trying to do with it I I just don't want to get into that right now
P2	okay well thanks for listening and honestly I I am really worried about the smoking so okay
P1	Iappreciate your care
P2	I'm here to help
P1	okay okay
