P1	many people have told me if I quit smoking I'm gonna gain weight well food really doesn't taste good but they say it tastes much better if you quit smoking
P2	mm-hmm
P1	now the downside to that is I'm gonna gain weight
P2	mm-hmm
P1	that means a new wardrobe which I'd like to have but I can't afford
P2	so right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life it's been a part of your life off and on for 18 years it's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought I'll never smoke then
P1	yeah
P2	and your worry is that if you stop you will end up gaining weight so I'm hearing this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive about stopping I'm wondering what else might be on that list
P1	withdrawal hmm they say it's awful being cranky
P2	mm-hmm
P1	and if I do go through this I just hope my friends understand and will support me and what I'm trying to do
P2	mm-hmm okay yeah so added to the other other list is they're having to go through the withdrawal the unpleasantness of that
P1	okay
P2	what else might be on the not-so-good side about smoking and that's talking
P1	um I think everything's on the bad sad about smoking but I'm just smoked so long I just can't imagine not going through life without smoking I know I've got to stop I'm having no health problems from cigarettes
P2	mm-hmm
P1	at present but when the doctor told me this morning what could be waiting for me in the future
P2	mm-hmm
P1	that made me rethink everything
