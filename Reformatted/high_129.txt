None	welcome Jane I'm Stacey how are you today
P1	fine thank you
P2	that's good to hear is okay if we just go over a couple of your details
P1	yes that's okay
P2	okay so from the forms that you've filled in earlier today we found out that you're a  year old female you have bad knees and have been recently diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis you have recently sustained a tear to your right shoulder culturally you're from a Fijian Indian background you work part-time and have lived in Australia for  years you mentioned earlier that you also assault Carol for you to disable children is that correct
P1	yes that's correct
P2	I appreciate how difficult it must be for you to look after your children by yourself now tell me what brings you here today
P1	my doctor recently suggested I should lose weight and exercise more in order to take pressure off my knees and joints I know I need to lose more weight and my diet can be unhealthy at times and I don't exercise as much as I should I also find that my knees ache from cooking in the kitchen all day for my family and cleaning the house every other day you say your doctor suggested you to come here today but did you want to come here as well I think with my doctor making a point of me coming it bought it to my attention more I know I'm more a little overweight and maybe I should improve on my on my health for me and for my children say the doctor mentioned that excess weight was not helping the pain either
P2	you said that your doctor mentioned that you should come here today that perhaps maybe I can help you some of these issues if you were to change or improve any area of your life where would it be
P1	I guess to try and lose more weight and take the pressure off monies I'm starting to feel uncomfortable in my clothing and finding that I get tired when i walk small distances and big need to feel frumpy and heavy on my feet and I'd like to be not so puffed out when I walk small distances being on my feet so long makes my joints ache as
P2	well it must be difficult feeling that way and uncomfortable hopefully I can help you with this how important is it for you to change your life right now on a scale of  to
P1	I would like to say about  I think I'm ready to make a change in my life I'm always doing things for other people um I've been listening to my friends and they say I should start looking after myself more
P2	that's good to hear that your friends are looking after you how confident are you being able to make a change in your life honestly
P1	I'm not sure I've tried to lose weight before I lose a little and then put it back on usually when I'm busy
P2	your stress
P1	I'm not set on the fact that exercise can be effective for me when I exercise my knees hurt and I don't want to lift every ways I understand how difficult it must be for you to lose weight and put it back on again
P2	but you did say that you could lose weight how did it make you feel at the time
P1	I felt Gordon was proud of myself and I went out and even bought a new top
P2	so it sounds like that when you lost weight you felt better that's great and why do you think exercise may not have worked or being so effective for you
P1	I'm not quite sure maybe because I wasn't doing the right things or getting the right advice you could be right can you see that maybe at the time this is why am i noticing improvements I know it should have probably seeked out more advice from a professional again it was just the timing of it and I thought I could do it myself
P2	I'm sure you could do it by yourself but a little assistance and some knowledge never hurts what do you think changed that made you potentially put the weight back on
P1	I think because I stopped walking on the treadmill I wasn't really caring about the amount of carbs i ate at mealtimes and in my culture we eat a lot of rotor which is our form of bread we ate this with most meals I don't really do anything else but take occasional medication for the pain
P2	okay it's important for you to recognize that amount of bread that you're eating probably wouldn't have helped and also the fact that you stop walking on the treadmill would lower your capacity to burn that food which an along one would affect your rheumatoid arthritis now that you say it
P1	I probably knew that it's just Bernard recently to find the time and to get back on the treadmill I work part-time and my children take a lot of my time up so it's really difficult and I hardly get a minute to myself that's completely understandable
P2	from what I can gather your main issues preventing you from exercise include time and family obligations basically
P1	yes it's stress for loving to be the sole carer for my family I love my children but they can be hard work it must be but
P2	you can see in order to lose weight and improve on your symptoms diet modifications and some sort of exercise need to be implemented into your daily routine yes that make sense
P1	but do you really think that this would help me
P2	of course it would but you'll need to be committed to your own personal improvements look at how committed you are although it is hard work looking after your family that's true I see your point what do you think it would take to change your mind about participating in physical activity
P1	maybe being able to do exercises that don't take too much time up things I could do at home or it would be great if I could in of my children sometimes
P2	okay so if you were given a program that was realistic with time and easy completed at home do you think you could do this
P1	I think I could give it to go I want to improve my overall fitness I would also like to feel comfortable in myself and reduce the aches and pains in my body great
P2	so it seems as though you have put a lot of thought into your overall goals what if i say to you come back and see me in two weeks do you think in that time you would at least attempt to start the program provided
P1	yes i think i could give it a real girl and try to make it a priority for the next two weeks
P2	on a scale of one to ten how confident are you that you'll be successful
P1	i'm going to say nine out of  because nothing certain that's an interesting way to look at it
P2	hopefully we can get you to  by the end of it hopefully so I can see you're willing to make an effort let's say we meet here in two weeks then hopefully it's hopefully you have some competing exercise of sessions and progress to show me I try my hardest that's all I ask for i'm looking forward to helping you through this journey Jane it was nice to meet you
P1	you too
