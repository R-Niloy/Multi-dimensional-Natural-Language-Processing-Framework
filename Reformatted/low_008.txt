P2	Hi Emily how are you
P1	I'm doing right how are you
P2	I'm good um Wow what's changed what do we have here
P1	oh I got my lip pierced
P2	Emily why why did you get your lip pierced
P1	why I don't wanted to change and you can kind of cool
P2	gorgeous your teeth are lovely you do not need a piercing
P1	I mean nobody needs up here saying I wanted one or then
P2	do you know what those oral piercings can do to your teeth
P1	I mean it's my lip that's pierced not my teeth
P2	well yes except that you know what's going to happen see how do you feel how when you're moving your lips smile for me okay so do you see how when your muscles are moving that piercing is rubbing against your gums as well as your teeth so we can see some recession that's going to start to happen
P1	yeah
P2	possibly affecting the tooth itself chipping the tooth etc so it's something that we definitely don't like to see
P1	I mean it's been okay so far it doesn't cause me any problems
P2	well it's only been a month
P1	yeah
P2	okay orderly days yet and it might not be a bad idea to reconsider the piercing
P1	I mean I just chose it I'm not going to take it right out it's like you said I've only had it in for a month I mean
P2	Emily I've been seeing you for so long and you know that I really just I think you have lovely teeth and I've watched you you know just mature etc and I hate I'd hate to see you wreck your teeth for something like this I really would
P1	well I mean if it starts to cause a problem then maybe talk about but at this point I mean
P2	all right all right okay okay okay we'll continue the exam but you know where I stand on this okay
P1	all right
P2	all right
