None	hi Emily how are you?
P1	I'm doing right how are you?
P2	I'm good um Wow what's changed? what do we have here?
P1	oh I got my lip pierced
P2	Emily why why did you get your lip pierced why? I don't wanted to change and you can kind of cool gorgeous your teeth are lovely you do not need a piercing
P1	I mean nobody needs up here saying I wanted one or
P2	then do you know what those oral piercings can do to your teeth?
P1	I mean it's my lip that's pierced not my teeth
P2	well yes except that you know what's going to happen see how do you feel how when you're moving your lips smile for me okay so do you see how when your muscles are moving that piercing is rubbing against your gums as well as your teeth? so we can see some recession that's going to start to happen yeah possibly affecting the tooth itself chipping the tooth etc so it's something that we definitely don't like to see
P1	I mean it's been okay so far it doesn't cause me any problems
P2	well it's only been a month yeah okay orderly days yet and it might not be a bad idea to reconsider the piercing
P1	I mean I just chose it I'm not going to take it right out it's like you said I've only had it in for a month
P2	I mean Emily I've been seeing you for so long and you know that I really just I think you have lovely teeth and I've watched you you know just mature etc and I hate I'd hate to see you wreck your teeth for something like this I really would
P1	well I mean if it starts to cause a problem then maybe talk about but at this point I mean all right
P2	all right okay okay okay we'll continue the exam but you know where I stand on this okay all right all right
