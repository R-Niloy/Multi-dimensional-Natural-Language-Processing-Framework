P2	hello kelsey thank you for coming in today I'm Shelley see our own personal trainers I shall be through you um so why are you here today there's some behaviors you want to change anything that you want to take care of
P1	yeah I'm here because I would like stop eating so much sugar primarily in the form of candy
P2	okay
P1	as I work out a lot i would say high intensities and I just feel like I'm always striving for this healthy lifestyle but then I will eat soon so girls in one sitting and it kind of ruins everything that I'm working toward
P2	all right so um what are some pros and cons to eating candy
P1	well pros aren't that is delicious
P2	it is
P1	and cons obviously it's not good for anything down the road I don't want to make it a habit because I honestly don't want to develop any chronic diseases or um it enables me to not lose weight even though it's not really goal but kind of always the goal um it doesn't make me feel good afterward that's for sure
P2	what was that
P1	is enjoyable in the moment
P2	alright so what I hear you saying is that you really enjoy how can you taste and it makes you feel good at the moment I'm assuming because you're getting the pleasure oh you can't be um but afterwards you just you don't like the way that makes your body feel you feel bogged down and gross and then potentially see the side effects of maybe unwanted weight gain and things that you're striving to prevent
P1	yeah that's exactly
P2	okay so on a scale of 0 to 10 how much do you think you can make the change to quit eating candy
P1	well this has been a repeated effort for me so I'm going to say about a 7 because I feel like I can do it but I work around a lot of candy there's candy on my desk so it's kind of hard to resist
P2	okay well it's not a zero so you have some confidence in yours
P1	yeah
P2	all right um so when you say that you have candy at work is there any way you can get rid of that
P1	now because I work for an athletic director and the can use for the athletes post bay but
P2	sometimes just thank you know the cookies over or katie jo should i say all right so what are your goals how do you see yourself quitting in canyons
P1	well i would like to start making like a foo dog and not lying to myself about how much candy i'm actually eating when i eat 32 the rules i should write down that I didn't
P2	all right that's started
P1	you know maybe check that for six weeks and see if actually looking at how much candy I meeting will help me realize that it's
P2	okay good good so what are you saying correct me if I'm wrong is you think that logging your sugar intake is going to help you see on top of the way you feel after you eat candy how much can you you're actually eating
P1	right yeah I'm going with that do i can write down you know how much i sleep or what else i'm eating and see if the g3 some candy helps with other
P2	okay
P1	lifestyle factors
P2	good good i understand that it's really hard quitting kidding i myself have been known in the past you eat a ton of canyon or the city right right this or can you explain me again just some more reasons why you think it's going to be hard and why you think you can do it
P1	well i think it's gonna be hard because i work every day but monday that it's on my chest tuesday and thursday i work in the morning so it's less likely for me to snack on it i don't really know why i just don't think about it in the morning and i'm only there for three hours so that would definitely be a reason why i would have a hard time resisting it but this this last week I've been putting up signs from the candies door that says no candy all right Pizza sticky
P2	okay no good that's a good story
P1	always help quick
P2	and can you clarify for me one more time the kind of pleasure you get from eating candy
P1	well obviously taste I'm sure it stimulates some sort of happy memories
P2	okay
P1	um you know how we Easter Christmas is all about the candy
P2	yeah so what you're saying is that candy brings back good memories and it tastes good and it makes you happy but at the same time it frustrates you and you're having a hard time letting it go because of work I mean it's hard to get rid of things when they're so prevalent in your life and candy is everywhere we look
P1	but strong
P2	so I would just like to understand a little bit more on how you're going to put definite goals I'd like to write down four goals for you on how we want to derail your need for handy
P1	okay well so the first one I'm going to do is log my I think I'm gonna log all night and day
P2	okay
P1	including candy
P2	good
P1	and fruit could probably be it would be a definite factor in that as well um secondly I'm going to continue to put up those post-it notes in front of the candy jar saying that I should not eat candy network
P2	okay
P1	um thirdly I have a Fitbit and I was thinking about writing like no sugar really small bed in it you know just as a reminder just when I think that nicca now probably shouldn't what do you have any suggestions about what
P2	have you ever considered maybe talking to your boss I'll moving the candy jar from the table to maybe an instant table next to the door or something so it's out of reach
P1	right every two no I haven't but that's a good idea or even talk to him about so Jana with fruit or really anything else besides candy
P2	because really i mean its athletes we're working with you and athlete like yourself
P1	i'll be passing out candy
P2	should not be eating candy do i think that you can maybe make a push and get some gratification for yourself out of improving the lives of others one for being your own
P1	I think that a very good idea
P2	ok so you're really willing to make this change apparently
P1	yes I want to make this change
P2	ok um and you've already started you started with the post-it notes um my only other suggestion if you don't mind me giving you a suggestion
P1	how about that um
P2	would be like you said with the fruit consider all of the food you're taking in because sometimes after you exercise your body crave sugar because you're not getting enough complex car such as like bread or rice or something like that before you workout so your blood Sugar's just dropping so just monitor the way you feel more than just the pleasure since you get from the delicious
P1	yeah all right
P2	do you have any questions
P1	no I think that we've caught with a really good plan here and I'm excited to give it a go this week
P2	all right well I'm excited for you so I'll will take a look at the log and we'll reevaluate these goals here in about two weeks and we'll see how the candy is going hopefully your boss will work with you some
P1	okay
P2	all right well thank you
P1	thank you
P2	good day
P1	good
