P2	I would see having nine out of ten
P1	okay and why is it nine another two or lower number
P2	because like I said it is really important for me to manage time to exercise so that my diabetes can be managed and controlled
P2	and on the same scale of zero to ten how confident are you in being able to make the change
P1	I soon I'm probably at eight at a time
P2	okay and so would I be correct in saying that it's very important to you so it's nine out of ten to make time to exercise to stay healthy and mainly to avoid having to take medication to manage your diabetes and your confidence level is at eight out of ten and being able to make this change
P1	yeah
P2	okay so looking back is there a reason that you haven't been able to make time talk to sighs
