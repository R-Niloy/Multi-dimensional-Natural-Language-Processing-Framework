P1	Right, I my daughter's 17 years old okay. she she's actually very high-functioning thankfully and you know I went to three of these programs and none of them
P2	so you're looking you're looking for a day program right and something that really was good for your daughter
P1	Right, right, and I mean I was looking for a program that would stimulate her, you know that would that she'd really enjoy going to but I mean they were either like babysitting programs or they were just the participants were all at like different developmental levels so that she couldn't really she could make friends
P1	
P1	no not she did not she she just there just was wasn't that that sense of like that common commonality you know just she there was no um no basis or like friendships there was there were there were some young young people there who are like screaming yelling and who are talking to themselves and she didn't know how to engage
P2	so so just there wasn't when when you visited they didn't sort of the program didn't help you to connect sir help your daughter to connect to anything that was going on that you were Just sort of viewing it
P1	right, well I mean I observed for a whole day in each of these programs
P2	okay
P1	 which was there's a lot of time yeah yeah I mean like you know I work full time and I don't it was very difficult to schedule time to go to these places and once I did it was just so disappointing
