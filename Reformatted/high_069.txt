P2	Barbara Roberts
P1	yes
P2	hello there my name is dr. Bedi I'm one of the new GPS in the practice first of all what would you like me to call you
P1	well you can call me Barbara that'll be fine
P2	okay that's fine okay so Barbara I'm seeing you today but I think it'
P1	s usually dr. Brown that's seeing she was that right
P2	yes dr. Brown's my doctor okay what is it that's brought you to see me today
P1	well I've come about my tummy problem I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it and I thought perhaps I'd come and see you to see if you could help all
P2	right okay can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems
P1	um well I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time it very often feels bloated I I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes and other times it stops it's a real stabbing feeling I often have the urge to go to the toilet and and I pass very smelly wind
P2	so quite a few symptoms there and some of them sound quite troublesome to you
P1	yes
P2	okay and how long has this been going on
P1	well I I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago I had a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea and and I don't think my stomach's have have been really right since then
P2	mm-hmm okay okay so you think it began about four years ago after this holiday
P1	yes
P2	okay and what what sort of treatments have you tried for this before
P1	well dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning but I've been to the health shop and and they've been really helpful they've given me lots of different tablets and medicines
P2	right
P1	for different things now or an imodium right I have imodium in my handbag all the time just in case right
P2	so these different tablets that you've got from the the herbal shop how are you taking them
P1	oh well different tablets you know I don't have the same problem every day so I'll take some tablets for certain symptoms
P2	right
P1	other tablets for other things
P2	so my am i right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis and what you're going to take demanding of what your stomach's doing
P1	yeah
P2	okay okay and what about tests have you had any tests for these problems
P1	yes I had in the early days I had a gastroschisis what are they a
P2	gastroscopy
P1	how's that the tubes down to the top
P2	okay
P1	and at the same time I had a barium enema
P2	right
P1	that was very uncomfortable
P2	okay
P1	but now I've tried what are you I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that that they didn't find anything he's he's just not sent me for any more that's it now as far as he's concerned sent me back to the doctor
P2	right sounds as though you're not happy with that
P1	well you know I think that actually the NHS is running out of money aren't they and he's decided that I've had enough tests my hand you know if you go on the internet there's loads of tests that he could have said before
P2	right
P1	if I had a bit more money I'd go private why I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it right
P2	so you feel as though actually enough hasn't been done in the way of
P1	notice he's not just loads more he could do I'm sure
P2	right okay it sounds like you've had these problems now for about four years you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach you've tried a lot of tablets some prescribed some herbal remedies and you've had some investigations but you're not entirely happy that you even been investigated thoroughly enough is that is that about a toast if I got the story right okay and can ask you Barbara how is all of this affecting you day to day how has it affecting your life
P1	while it's had quite quite big impact I mean the first thing the biggest thing I suppose is that I I went from being full-time to part-time at work I just couldn't sit all day comfortably and so in part-time but in the end I thought how about a year ago I stopped work altogether
P2	right
P1	and I miss that I miss the girls we used to used to go out at least once a week night to the pictures or Pro drink that's one thing
P2	though about something you quite enjoyed
P1	yes
P2	all right
P1	yes yes we just have a laugh right okay I used to go to swing in shape I used to go to an exercise class that was um I missed the exercise actually that was once a week but you know the thing was I wasn't comfortable never felt quite right doing all this exercise I was always worried I was going to be taken short or so I stopped that
P2	right
P1	um then well my husband I used to go out for meals
P2	mm-hmm
P1	that's another thing we don't do anymore now
P2	right
P1	hmm yes quite a few things really
P2	yeah it does it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed quite a lot because of these symptoms it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do
P1	hmm
P2	right what is it you'd spend your average day doing now
P1	well I put her around the house I spent perhaps a little bit too much time watching I've got a bit hooked on daytime television I have to say they draw you in don't they
P2	yes sir I do
P1	I read a bit the whole magazines but generally I'm at home
P2	right okay okay and have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms for example have there been any times when things have been better for you
P1	well last year my son got married and I have to say I was worried that that I wouldn't have to cope with it that I wouldn't be feeling well enough surprisingly enough I was in good form I think it was about three weeks in the summer getting ready for it and the whole who are of the wedding but I was in good really good form for that yeah that was a good time
P2	right and how were you Tommy symptoms then
P1	I hardly noticed them yes it it seemed to clear up
P2	nice sounds good right that's interesting hmm and are there any times when you Tommy symptoms bother you more it seemed particularly bad
P1	um well it's I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment it's particularly uncomfortable I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away he he travels with his job and he can be away a couple of times a month and that's not it it was very often not good then I have to say why does he
P2	notice it they're worse when your husband's not around mmm
P1	maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more I don't know when he's not there
P2	right I know you've been seeing dr. Brown about this for the last few years what is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you
P1	well he's he thinks it's all in my head my nose he's yeah he says it's stress why it's okay
P2	and what do you think
P1	well I mean it can't all be in my head I get too much physical pain or it to be in my head I mean it's real it's it's a real pain
P2	mm-hmm and have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it
P1	well I mean I I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up in the early stages but I think I mean sometimes I think it's IBS a friend of Mines got that and it sounds similar and then other times I think I wonder if it's an ulcer on a really bad day I start to think it might be cancer
P2	right
P1	um my mother-in-law my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a growth that the doctor didn't investigate
P2	right
P1	but by the time they'd found it it was the size of a football and it was it was too late to operate then so you know when I go to bed at night now and I just feel and make sure there's nothing different going on
P2	right
P1	and yeah I worry about that
P2	so you're kind of prodding having a feel at night oh you see if you can feel anything
P1	yeah I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there you know
P2	right okay okay so just to make sure that I've got the story straight you've you've seen dr. Brown for a couple of years you've you've tried a variety of medications some prescribed some from the herbal shop and none of them really made a great deal of difference you've had some investigations but you're perhaps feeling you've not had enough investigations and times you worried that this could be something quite serious like a cancer is that have I got a story right
P1	yes yeah I say so
P2	okay Bob well what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today
P1	well I thought you know you're a new doctor here and you've just finished your medical training I wondered whether you know with new eyes and new way of looking at at the problem might you probably know about different tests new tests that my doctor doesn't know about you know new developments all
P2	right
P1	so perhaps you could send me for some different tests
P2	right right so you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests
P1	hmm well I think this there's got to be something that tests might right reveal
P2	right okay well I think Barbara having having heard your story and heard about the symptoms I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you and the reason for that is because you've you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years and they've not shown anything and your symptoms haven't really changed that much so it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that they'd show anything different than what we already know so it would be I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests
P1	so it's like do you think it's all in my head then you're going to be like dr. Brown you think I'm imagining all of this
P2	no I think that you clearly have pain and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms and they're clearly getting in the way of your life causing you a lot of disability I guess I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body sometimes these things can go together I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married and you were very busy and quite happy that somehow your symptoms seemed less and then when your husband's away which is something you don't like very much sometimes somehow is your symptoms then will seem greater so I guess what I'm wondering Barbara is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind and what's going on in your life and and how much you symptoms trouble you do you think that's a possibility
P1	well I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain
P2	I'm not saying that the pains in your mind I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel and the way that our lives are going can impact how we notice our symptoms given that we've tried medication for you and we've tried investigations and we've drawn a blank really with those none of those have really helped you I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems
P1	what sort of approach
P2	well I guess thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years your life has really changed it seems to have really shrunk down and it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do that you used to get pleasure out of is that right
P1	well I just can't do them yeah I can't do them anymore
P2	and I guess I wonder it sounds as though you've you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them but I wonder if in a funny way what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now has kind of fed into you feeling unhappy with the way that that your life is at the moment and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you
P1	oh I don't know I don't know
P2	I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life and what you do with your day and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things you know even if it's just meeting up with your female friends once a week and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally improve your quality of life I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking and the fact that you you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it's worth for sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which are helping you which are doing nothing and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse I guess
P1	hmm
P2	what would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say two or three months just to see whether or not it makes any difference
P1	well two or three months is a long time if there is something going on I mean that's what happened to my mother-in-law you know they left her and didn't spot it and
P2	well I guess if we if we did decide to work together like this in this new approach I'd be seeing you regularly we can keep an eye on your symptoms and if they change then we can investigate as appropriate but if they stay the same then you know we could be pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that that we're missing now would that sound
P1	so what are you saying then that I should come back and see you
P2	I think that would be a good idea I think we've only just begun to talk about it and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back perhaps if you booked in for a double slot next week and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach and perhaps if you could also bring your your tablets in or make a list of them we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there how would that sound Barbara
P1	okay well to make an appointment for next week yeah come back and see you again and talk about it a bit more
P2	yes I think so I think that would be a good a good start
P1	and I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking yeah I don't bring all the bottles down
P2	okay all right okay all right so shows thank you again next week
P1	I'll make an appointment for next week illness
P2	all right Thank You Barbara
P1	okay bye
