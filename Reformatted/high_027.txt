P2	okay Tamra so I just finished reevaluate your gums
P1	yeah
P2	and we did your scaling and root planing just a few weeks ago
P1	uh-huh
P2	and I wanted to let you know that we didn't get the response that we were looking for
P1	Oh No
P2	so I wanted to ask you on a scale from one to ten ten being the best on being the worst how important is it to you
P1	about four or five
P2	okay what do you think it would take to move you to a seven or an eight
P1	maybe some more information because you know I'm newly diabetic so I'm just learning you know my diet and taking my medicine and stuff and sometimes I forget to take my medicine but you know maybe if you could help me with that
P2	okay so tell me what you know about the relationship between diabetes and gum disease
P1	I know that it you know it kind of goes together but I'm not really sure anything else about it
P2	that's true that's true that's good the relationship between your gums and your diabetes if your diabetes is not well controlled it's not it's not a good thing your gums tissues tend to be more irritated they believe much more easily your gum disease progresses much quicker and how long has it been since you've seen your doctor
P1	my Sultan last week and he took like work and then he called me back and he said that my number was like 7.5 and it's not really where he wanted me to be at but he said since I was so new that you know I just still needed to work on my diet and taking the medicine we need to give it a little bit longer and see if that won't help
P2	okay good sounds like you're really motivated and you're doing some research and kind of staying on top of it that's you know trying
P1	I'm trying to get the diet down
P2	good
P1	that's a little bit different
P2	good what would you say is your biggest challenge for keeping it well controlled
P1	I'm probably taking my medicine because I forget a lot of times you know I just I don't really take any other medicines and that's the you know and I need to take it every day he said so sometimes I do forget so that that could be it
P2	okay well I have a couple of suggestions and I think what help is that okay
P1	yeah
P2	okay the first thing I think would be a good idea would be that you put your medication near your toothbrush
P1	that would work yeah because you're taking it at night
P2	right right
P1	and it's metformin
P2	right
P1	okay so if you put your toothbrush and your medication side by side then you would be brushing your teeth at night before you go to bed which is very important yes and then you can take your medication and you'd be less likely to forget
P2	that's right that would I mean that would work
P1	okay good so now tell me with the information I've given you today how would you say what would you say be a 1 or a 10 in regards to taking better care of your gums where would you be
P2	I don't probably I need to be you know more like a seven or eight because it is really affecting you know my cleaning and everything if I don't take my medicine and don't you know get my diabetes under control
P1	well good I think we have a plan and I think we're gonna see better results next thank you
